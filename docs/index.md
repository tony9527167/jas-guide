# Tony's Jagged Alliance Series Systems & Tactics Guide

A **mechanics-first technical reference** for Jagged Alliance 2 vanilla _v1.12_ and _Wildfire_.

## What this site is

This is not a walkthrough.

This is a **system-level guide** to how **Jagged Alliance 2 actually works** —  
covering **v1.12** and **Wildfire**, with a focus on:

- How the two major versions _really_ differ
- Combat resolution (accuracy, interrupts, suppression, damage)
- Stealth, vision, and detection
- AI behavior and tactical decision-making

Most JA2 information online is **fragmented, outdated, or mixed across versions**.  
This site exists to fix that.

Everything here is built as a **mechanics reference** — not opinion, not anecdotes.

## How this guide is built

All information is derived from:

- Verified in-game testing in JA2 **v1.12** and **Wildfire**
- Original developer documentation and patch notes
- **2,000+ hours** of long-term play across multiple full campaigns
- Cross-version comparison of how the engine behaves

Where possible, **rules, formulas, and edge cases** are documented — not just tips.

If something behaves strangely in JA2, it is probably explained here.

## Supported versions

This guide currently covers:

- **Jagged Alliance 2** (Gold), v1.12 (04.12.02)
- **Jagged Alliance 2: Wildfire**, v6.04 (12.01.06)

Mods, AI overhauls, and fan patches are documented only when explicitly stated.

This archive is maintained by a long-time JA2 player  
and exists to preserve the original design and mechanics of the Jagged Alliance 2 series in a form that can be **tested, referenced, and trusted**.
