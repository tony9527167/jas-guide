## The Story

In the small Latin American country of Arulco, an unscrupulous dictator named Deidranna rules.

In 1999, a coup d'état failed in its goal of liberating the land and introducing democratic elections.
No one knows exactly what fate befell the mercenary units operating in the country.

The hard fact is that the small nation is now, as it was before, completely in the hands of Deidranna—the Romanian-born wife of the rightful ruler,
Enrico Chivaldori, who now lives in exile. And once again, new trouble brews in Arulco. U.S. investigations have uncovered secret drug trafficking channels.
In this already plundered land, a newly formed and extremely active drug mafia with international connections has emerged.
The cartel has become an all-pervasive power, which is why Arulco has once again become the focus of international political interest.

You will be operating under contract with the Central Intelligence Agency and smuggled into the country with a troop of mercenaries.
Your task is to finish what was not achieved in 1999: to smash the ever-present drug cartel in Arulco.
Your authorization is a letter carried from the exiled President Enrico Chivaldori, whose contacts with the rebels may prove invaluable.

Believe us when we say: no easy task awaits you! You'll need the strategic insight of a general, the negotiating skills of a diplomat,
the financial savvy of a CEO—and a squad of some of the deadliest mercenaries ever to hit the streets.
Should you fail, your "client" will deny all knowledge of your existence.

This is Jagged Alliance 2: WildFire, an exciting mix of strategy and role-playing that puts you in charge of a nation's fight for freedom.
You'll hire a core group of skilled professionals through A.I.M., the Association of International Mercenaries.
You'll win the local population over to your side by displaying courage and loyalty.
You'll train your men around the clock, then send them into dangerous missions and lethal firefights.
You'll conquer the depths of underground mines, reap their riches, and uncover their secrets.

Each success will bring you closer to total victory; each failure must be overcome with iron determination.
Sometimes a tactical withdrawal can achieve more than a costly battle. Retreat from one sector only to surprise the enemy by attacking another flank.
Some enemy bases may seem impregnable at first—for example, Drassen. Here you must grow stronger step by step, slowly gaining ground.
In the end, you will prevail if you remember a few things: stay focused on your goal, keep your men supplied with both ammunition and inspiration,
and keep the cash flowing—because nothing is nastier than a mercenary whose paycheck just bounced.

To jump into the game, simply turn the page.
This introduction will show you the most important basic moves in Jagged Alliance 2: WildFire without explaining every single step.
More detailed information about strategy and tactics for the campaigns is provided in the following chapters. The battle for Arulco can begin.

### Bornell, Steve "Grizzly"

![Grizzly](/public/ja2wf-legacy-official-site/mercs/Grizzly.jpg)

A bear of a man, Grizzly Bornell carries the big guns of battle with authority. Even though heavy weapons are his specialty, he is just as lethal when left empty-handed.

Additional Info:

- Big, burly, a bear of a man.
- His toughness is to such an extent it borders on comical. It's understated. No need for kickass statements, it's just understood.

Early on he was an adviser in Cuba, now his list of foreign exp. is as long as your arm. Heavy and automatic weapons are in the best hands with Henning.

- Hates to work with Buzz Garneau.

### Dahan, Fidel

![Fidel](/public/ja2wf-legacy-official-site/mercs/Fidel.jpg)

Due to numerous employee complaints concerning his refusal to follow orders, Fidel "Leave me alone, I'm busy!" Dahan was recently suspended for a thirty-day period. Promising a changed attitude, he was returned to active duty by A.I.M. though because he is so proficient with both firearms and explosives. Fidel hasn't quite been himself lately.

Additional Info:

- Aggressive, slightly psychotic.
- Has a comical ruthlessness to him. Conveyed by a short, heavy, Cuban accent.

Fresh out of med school, Doctor Dawson eagerly awaits his first assignment. Although his innocent and youthful appearance has prevented others from taking him seriously but rest assured, once he saves a couple of lives, he'll be shown the kind of respect he deserves. For a man who just completed his internship, he can certainly wield a mean scalpel.

Additional Info:

- Young, inexperienced, a little chattier than most of the others.
- Uses some scientific terminology.
- Enthusiastic and somewhat brash.
- Surprises himself on occasion as he feels his way through combat.

### Dolvich, Igor

![Igor](/public/ja2wf-legacy-official-site/mercs/Igor.jpg)

Following in his uncle's footsteps won't be easy for Igor. His uncle Ivan Dolvich is legendary. Igor may be new to A.I.M. but he is by no means new to armed combat--he developed his abilities for stealth while in action in Chechnya. Most importantly, his bloodline speaks volumes about his potential. Igor and Ivan are already being referred to as the Russian "I-Team."

Additional Info:

- Russian accent.
- Has had plenty of exposure to alcohol, though not a drunk.
- Uses odd expressions, which sometimes come off as strange and funny.

![Ivan](/public/ja2wf-legacy-official-site/mercs/Ivan.jpg)

Ivan, a former highly decorated Red Army Major, joined the organization over three years ago on a freelance assignment. Despite serious difficulties communicating in English, he took the mercenary world by storm, breaking all kill-rate records and tallying up the kind of stats that perhaps only he himself is capable of breaking. In order to improve his relationship with commanders, Ivan has enrolled in an "English as a second lanGauge" course.

Additional Info:

- Dialogue a blend of Russian and English.
- Struggles for words in English, tends to fall into Russian during tense moments.

![Lucky](/public/ja2wf-legacy-official-site/mercs/Lucky.jpg)

Then he discovered someone having a go at his little sister and in his rage, broke the persons neck: an accident. The victim was unfortunately a VIP and therefore Luc had go underground by the mercenaries.

Additional Info: This muscleman is a weapon on legs. Close combat would be enough for him, but with automatic weapons he is unbeatable!

### Garneau, Lousia "Buzz"

![Buzz](/public/ja2wf-legacy-official-site/mercs/Buzz.jpg)

Buzz Garneau's life has undergone some major changes in the past year. She had a major falling out with Lynx; they can barely stand to be on the same planet. Her tell-all book, "Under Cover, Under Lynx," has been rejected by every publisher who's seen it. While all of this has left her bitter, she has been able to channel her anger into her work with firearms.

Garneau was recently certified as a heavy weapons specialist.

Additional Info:

- Buzz and Lynx we're in a relationship. He broke it off.
- She hates him, and men in general, because of it.

### Gontarski, Bobby "Steroid"

![Steroid](/public/ja2wf-legacy-official-site/mercs/Steroid.jpg)

The transition from fighting fires to fire-fights has been quite the success for this ex-fireman from Warsaw. His knowledge of mechanics kept the outdated and under-funded Polish firehouse running.

- Type of guy who hangs out at the gym staring at himself in the mirror.
- Impatient, prone to outbursts in certain situations.
- Full of himself.
- His stilted command of English and lack of intelligence can be comical at times.

- She is extremely conscious of her looks and uses it to her advantage.
- Voice is extremely sexy, with a hint of sweetness.

### Higgens, Charlene "Raven"

![Raven](/public/ja2wf-legacy-official-site/mercs/Raven.jpg)

Former L.A.P.D. SWAT team sharpshooter, Sgt. Charlene Higgens left the force for A.I.M. so she could work alongside her husband, Ron Higgens. They prefer to take assignments together since operate with the precision of a solitary unit. If you listen to them though, you'd never realize they're married; they rarely acknowledge their personal lives during work. Raven is qualified in night operations.

Additional Info:

- A female version of her husband. They belong together.
- Less obsessive about being in charge.
- Lighter, more prone to humor
- More open and outgoing.

### Higgens, Ron "Raider"

![Raider](/public/ja2wf-legacy-official-site/mercs/Raider.jpg)

Lt. Ron Higgens is a former commander of the Los Angeles SWAT team. When he fell in love with his ace sniper, Sgt. Charlene Higgens, they managed to keep their relationship a secret up until a year ago. When they decided to marry, the L.A.P.D. refused to allow them to continue working together, so they joined A.I.M. He's organized, experienced, and decisive. Raider is a natural leader.

### Huaong, "Dr. Q"

![DrQ](/public/ja2wf-legacy-official-site/mercs/DrQ.jpg)

Doctor Huaong draws much of his medical knowledge from the branches of the ancient healing traditions. His marksmanship may be a little poor, but Dr. Q's expertise in so many other disciplines--night operations, guerrilla warfare tactics, and martial arts-more than make up for it, and he could easily double his fees.

Additional Info

- Spiritual and somewhat mystical
- Formal use of English, though he's well-versed enough to use contractions
- He's comes off as being respectful, yet he sometimes uses it as a guise to make snide remarks.
- His dialogue is littered with spiritual connotations.

### Dr. Houston, Donna "Spider"

![Spider](/public/ja2wf-legacy-official-site/mercs/Spider.jpg)

Military trained in the treatment of trauma, Doctor Houston is unequalled in giving medical aid under the most adverse conditions. On the darkest nights or during the fiercest tropical storms, the wounded can count on Spider to provide quick, quiet, and effective emergency care. Don't let the nickname fool you. She got it from her fear of spiders and not from a prickly personality.

Additional Info:

- Friendly, scientific and analytical.
- Athletic, slightly tomboyish, spent her childhood hanging out with boys.
- Finds no pleasure in killing, would rather just play doctor.
- Most probably became a merc for the challenge of field treatment.

### Jessop, Norma "Meltdown"

![Meltdown](/public/ja2wf-legacy-official-site/mercs/Meltdown.jpg)

Don't mess with Meltdown. She may be smiling in her file photo, but that smile is certainly deceptive. This mercenary is legendary; an enemy once died at her feet from fear before Meltdown had even raised her weapon. As for her taste in weapons, the bigger, the better. In fact, Meltdown has a tendency for overkill in virtually every aspect of her life. Jessop is remarkably ambidextrous; she can easily fire two weapons simultaneously.

Additional Info:

- Foul-mouthed, kickass woman, who could clear a bar in no time.
- You'd shake in fear just looking at her.
- Loves violence and killing, disturbingly so.
- Has an all-around hate for humanity, in general.

### Kaufman, Thor

![Thor](/public/ja2wf-legacy-official-site/mercs/Thor.jpg)

This vegetarian New Age healer has an amazing grasp of medicine for a man who's never seen the inside of a university med school. He also has a decent grasp for killing quickly and quietly. Born on outskirts of Berlin, he now calls California home where he lives in the mountains with his newborn son and ex-wife, Cassandra.

Additional Info

- Slight German accent
- An easy-going new age, professional killer with scientific terminology in his dialogue

- He switches between the direct rigidity of his upbringing and his new found inner-tranquillity.

### Koleshnikov, Victor "Monk"

![Monk](/public/ja2wf-legacy-official-site/mercs/Monk.jpg)

The Russian born Victor Kolesnikov is exactly who would be called a Hard case. Automatic weapons are his area of skill. He very often seeks solitude and does not speak any more than necessary which is why his comrades call him Monk. A fitting nick name for this taciturn pro, who is also a camouflage expert.

Additional Info

- He has a problem with his fellow Russian Ivan.
- Because of his experiences in Tschetschenia he is choosy about his clientsRussian

### Nettleson, Sidney

![Sidney](/public/ja2wf-legacy-official-site/mercs/Sidney.jpg)

Whether it's sharing a spot of tea with British blue-bloods or putting a .38 slug into an unwanted nuisance, Sidney does it with poise and dignity. Sidney combines the mannerisms of the upper crust with the lighting quickness of a Wild West gunslinger. Years of avid cricket-playing have also given him a much-feared throwing arm.

Additional Info

- Snob, prim and proper.
- No matter what the situation, he never loses his dignity.
- Formal British accent.
- Cheerful, polite, optimistic professional.

### Peters, John "Bull"

![Bull](/public/ja2wf-legacy-official-site/mercs/Bull.jpg)

He's a massive man of very few words. John Peters prefers to let his actions speak for him. Despite his experience as a U.S. Army MP, he has a concerted lack of respect for authority and angers easily. He probably spent as much time IN the brig as he did guarding it. Bull is the type of soldier who puts the grunt back into grunt work. Bull packs more power in his punch than anyone else currently on our roster.

Additional Info:

- Mean, intolerant, aggressive.
- Says as few words as possible.
- Gets through any situation thrown at him with brute force.
- Sarcastic bar-brawler, rather than out-and-out cruel.

### Dr. Quinten, Quinten "Danny"

Doctor David Quinten is a mountaineer, skydiver, and mobile medical practitioner. During Operation Desert Storm, he developed a reputation for jumping out of helicopters to operate on wounded soldiers that were lying out in the middle of sandy mine fields. Even more remarkably, Danny wouldn't call in evacuation until the patient was well on his way to recovery. He has been known to be a bit of a lone wolf.

Additional Info:

- A sociable loner. He enjoys people, but appreciates being alone with his thoughts
- An intellectual, who gets into combat for the pure adventure.
- Type of guy that can't stand still when stuff is going on around him.
- Risks his life for calculated fun

### Roberts, Rudy "Lynx"

![Lynx](/public/ja2wf-legacy-official-site/mercs/Lynx.jpg)

### Sheppards, Carl "Reaper"

![Reaper](/public/ja2wf-legacy-official-site/mercs/Reaper.jpg)

Otherwise known as The Assassin, if you come face-to-face with Carl Sheppards, chances are you're on your last breath. The Reaper takes pride in his patience. He strides silently and uses his stealth skills to gain easy access to his victims. Carl also gets a kick out of looking them in

the eye just before they die. One of his former CO's described him as "potentially too dangerous even for A.I.M. service."

Additional Info:

- A loner, though not anti-social.
- Sees death and killing as something spiritual.
- Carries himself as if living on another plane of existence.
- He's almost spooky, has an unsettling calmness.

### Simmons, Kyle "Shadow"

![Shadow](/public/ja2wf-legacy-official-site/mercs/Shadow.jpg)

This ex-Ranger and sniper has turned stalking into an art form. The Shadow could be lurking about right next to you and chances are you'd never know it. That snow drift, sand dune, or piece of shrubbery could be him. Kyle Simmons has made it his business to blend into any environment for any length of time. The Shadow brings his own camouflage supplies and he wishes to make it known up-front that he doesn't share.

Additional Info:

- Quiet, loner, low-key professional.
- Comments are usually made to himself rather than as conversation.
- Matter of fact type of guy, who doesn't draw attention to himself.
- Voice: should have whisper quality, but still be commanding.

### Smorth, Edgar "Nails"

![Nails](/public/ja2wf-legacy-official-site/mercs/Nails.jpg)

Edgar Smorth traded in his bike, leathers, and vest to become a full-time A.I.M. mercenary. In the year he's been with the organization, Nails has taken advantage of his knowledge about car bombs to become a military explosives expert. Despite his career change, he hasn't lost his combative edge or substantial belly he developed as a renegade biker. Edgar has a knack for getting into inaccessible places, just as long as they aren't too small and narrow.

Additional Info:

- Ex-biker, tough guy.
- Voice: Heavy, deep and raspy.
- Takes a jovial pleasure in killing.
- Likes let out a sick laugh when he's having fun.
- Calls people Scooter; a friendly put-down.

### Sonderguard, Monica "Buns"

![Buns](/public/ja2wf-legacy-official-site/mercs/Buns.jpg)

The prim and proper Monica Sonderguard may seem to be an unlikely candidate for the rough and tumble mercenary life, but she more than meets the minimum requirements. Before settling on A.I.M., Buns explored a number of careers: kindergarten teacher, geriatric nurse, Danish sharpshooter at the Atlanta Olympic games, and professional soldier.

Additional Info

- A prim and proper, prude.
- Believes herself better than anyone else.
- Has a sense of superiority. She's a merc because she wants to, not because she has to.
- Puts her feelings before logic.

### Spragg, Ernie "Red"

![Red](/public/ja2wf-legacy-official-site/mercs/Red.jpg)

This mad, mumbling Scotsman is from the old school of explosives where your instructor would fly by in pieces and you quickly moved up the ranks. Spragg is a survivor. With many years of experience under his wire cutters, he takes pride in teaching those military college kids a thing or two about detonation devices. Don't be thrown by Red's frantic ravings; the situation is rarely as dire as he likes to believe.

Additional Info

- Easily excitable. Goes off rants. Bit of a hothead
- Pessimist. Sees situations for their worst.
- Heavy Scottish accent.

### Steiger, Rudolf

![Rudolf](/public/ja2wf-legacy-official-site/mercs/Rudolf.jpg)

This former GSG 9 man has only one weakness. Dr. Laura Colin, who he met during a special training in Lübeck. He is an absolute Pro, Night operations are his strength. He can also shoot the nuts out of a squirrel's paws from 3 km. Has the talent to become a trainer.

Additional Info: His mode of expression leaves a lot to be desired. Works well with Henning von Branitz, but Gasket is the red cloth in a bullring

### Stevenson, Kirk "Static"

![Static](/public/ja2wf-legacy-official-site/mercs/Static.jpg)

The years may go by, but Static barely seems to mature. His experience and laid-back nature allows Kirk to best operate under the cover of darkness. He has served his commanders well with his mechanical abilities and knowledge of electronics. And don't be deceived--although he looks like a hippie, peace and love are the furthest things from his mind. Like his good friend Spider, Static can't stand the sight of insects.

Additional Info:

- Burnt out, deadhead, surfer dude.
- Principled enough to get the job done.
- Friendly, easy-going, somewhat focused even when he doesn't sound it.
