# JA2 Cheat Codes

**Foreword** : Before resorting to cheat codes, you should try to play through the game normally. Otherwise, you risk spoiling the fun!

If you get stuck—even on the easiest difficulty—try to push through with patience. Most situations can be solved without cheats. And if all else fails, you can always find help in one of the JA2 forums. For example, check the _JA2 Basis Forum_; often you'll find an answer using the search function, or receive help from other fans quickly.

Note: Using cheats is recorded in the logbook and can be traced at any time.  
Also, remember that using cheat codes is entirely at your own risk.

**Instructions** : First, you must activate cheat mode. Switch to the tactical screen and enter: `CTRL + IGUANA` (hold down CTRL while typing IGUANA).

After activation, the following cheats are available:
