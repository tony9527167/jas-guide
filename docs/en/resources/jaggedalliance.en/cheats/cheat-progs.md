# JA2 Cheat progs

This RAM editor is required to edit save-games in JA2, since they are encrypted.

Cheatfind, the program to edit save-games directly in RAM.

Since the save-games of Jagged Alliance 2 are encrypted, you must edit them directly in memory, i.e. while the game is running. At that point they are no longer encrypted. For this you need this RAM editor. How exactly it works can be found under [game hexing](./game-hexing.md). Many thanks also to Luzifer, who came up with the idea of using the RAM editor.
