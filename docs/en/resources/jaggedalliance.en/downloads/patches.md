## JA2 Gold 1.12 All in One

4.40 MB | Downloads: 18,903

This patch also includes the changes from JA2 patches 1.01 and 1.02, since these are missing in the original 1.12 patch!  
However, due to licensing reasons, the JA2Gold112.exe is not included.

It is recommended for JA2 Gold to first use the original 1.12 patch (updates the ja2gold.exe) and then apply this one (all other changes).
