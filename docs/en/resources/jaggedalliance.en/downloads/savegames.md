Here is a save-game for JA2 to make the start easier. Everything finest Spectra clothes - vision equipment - camouflage kit - locksmith kit - and as a highlight a C7 with all the trimmings, 100 rounds and a silencer.

## [ M9 p90 ] 79 KB | Downloads: 1281

Another save-game where one or two FN P90s can be found in M9. The special thing is that no IMP has been created yet and no other mercenaries have been hired either. The save-game is from the US version so you have to rename save-game10.sav to Spielstand10.sav to be able to use it in the DE version.

Difficulty: Experienced, additional guns: yes, time limit: no, Sci-Fi: no.
