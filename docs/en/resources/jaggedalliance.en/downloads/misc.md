This is the data.slf from the JA2 Demo.
You simply have to copy it into the Data directory of JA2.
If you have replaced your data.slf, the game becomes somewhat more difficult, as the enemies behave partly smarter.
(jumping over fences etc, fighting more in a team, generally better AI).

A card for the PC dashboard from Saitek, since the included one is probably not that great. It contains no background, for that you should best take one of the wallpapers from [ ja2.de ].
