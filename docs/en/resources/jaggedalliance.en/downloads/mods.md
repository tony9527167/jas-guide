## VWM

[ VWM ] 2.18 MB | Downloads: 11379

Weapon mod with over 30 new or modified weapons and 5 new maps.
Care was taken with the weapons to make them appear particularly realistic, also the deficit of MGs, shotguns, and sniper rifles was slightly increased, which in turn benefits the fun of the game.
