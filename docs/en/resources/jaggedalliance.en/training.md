# JA2 - Training

Here's how to train your mercenaries and best improve their attributes. This targeted, time-saving improvement and training is also called **Boosting**.

What exactly is Boosting?

- Boosting means excessively improving attributes, e.g., sneaking around for hours in turn-based mode or disarming mines, then laying down, disarming again, etc. - Luke

That's enough on that. In the list below from [Matrix](mailto:matrixweb@web.de) (whom I'm very grateful to for this list), you'll learn how to improve what:

Attributes marked with a \* cannot be boosted. It only states how they are improved.

**Health** :

- Load the mercenary (or an entire squad) with as heavy luggage as possible and switch to the mapscreen. That's the first step. Now double-click the sector they're in so you can assign a route. Do that too. In the left table, you can now see their target sector. Right-click on it to cancel the route. Repeat this several times, and health (along with strength) will increase. It's not unimportant which sector you're in. The desert works best. However, there shouldn't be a road leading out of the starting sector (that you'd travel over), as that strains the mercenaries the least. No time loss.
- Regeneration booster. As the name suggests, it only works for regeneration. It only boosts back the lost portion of health. Back to the maximum for that mercenary (sometimes multiple required). It cannot increase the maximum further.
- Walking around (from sector to sector or within a sector) (preferably overloaded).

**Agility** :

- To boost agility, sneak around near enemies (preferably at night). The condition is line of sight (from you to the enemy, not vice versa). The type of enemy doesn't matter, but animals prove safer since they move less if they don't hear noise. Sneaking past aliens smeared with monster slime from Gabby is also worthwhile, if unusual, way to boost agility. Another unusual one is tank sneaking. No time loss.
- Dodging attacks. No time loss.
- Endless reloading when standing next to an enemy in stealth mode. Same situation as sneaking, but save and reload repeatedly. Only worthwhile at the beginning when reload times are short. No time loss.

**Dexterity** :

- Tank bashing. Ha, it works! Sneak up first, then a short sprint and lie down in front of the tank. It can't hit you like that. Whenever it's your turn, stand up, swing 2-3 times, and duck again. (Trains dexterity and strength too). No time loss.
- Bashing the Ice Truck or Hummer.
- Bashing cows. Morally unacceptable for some, but that's how it is ;-). Also trains strength.
- Bashing enemies of all kinds. Doesn't count as boosting, but combat. No time loss. Also trains strength.
- Bashing civilians. Not recommended, as it lowers civilian morale. (Hey, let's beat you up, then we'll have better chances against Deidranna :-) ) Time loss depends on militia. If they're there, no time loss, but maybe mercenary loss. Also trains strength.
- Throwing knives (at vultures, enemies of all kinds, civilians, cows, ...) (Also trains strength with dexterity).
- Bandaging (e.g., wounded cows ;-)), repairing, and picking locks.

**Strength** :

- Push-ups (just kidding).
- See Health and Dexterity.
- Kicking down doors.

**Wisdom** :

- Disarming bombs. Tip: Use the Ctrl key. It's faster. Note: Wisdom under 40 cannot be increased. Same if explosive value is zero (even in v1.05, just slower).
- Quick bandaging (increases very slowly) (e.g., previously wounded cows ;-))
- Assign mercenaries the "Doctor" task in the map screen (also almost ineffective)

**Leadership** \* :

- Train militia, train militia, and train militia.

**Marksmanship** \* :

- Shooting at living beings or locks on doors.
- Hitting isn't bad (helps more, especially with hard-to-hit targets).

**Mechanics** \* :

- Picking locks.
- Repairing.

**Explosives** :

- Disarming and arming mines and bombs (prefer mines, completely safe).

**Medical** :

- See Wisdom (but increases much faster this way)

**Experience** :

- Everything else and much more.

**Energy** \* :

- Energy booster (duh, how insightful!).
- Drinking from water bottles.
- Drinking liquor (for risks and side effects, check the ~~forum~~ (It's in German, and the SSL certificate for this link is also invalid.) or ask [me](mailto:matrixweb@web.de), your doctor, or pharmacist).

**Morale** \* :

- Everything that makes the mercenaries happy. That would be all active things with no negative impact.
