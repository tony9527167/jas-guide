## Description

A burly man of few words, John Peters prefers to let his actions speak for him.  
Despite his experience in the U.S. Army's military police, he has little respect for authority and angers quickly.  
He has probably spent more time behind bars as an inmate than as a guard. Bull is a soldier who doesn't shy away from getting his hands dirty.

Additional Notes: Bull can hit harder than anyone currently on our payroll.

## Relationships

- Friends: Nails
