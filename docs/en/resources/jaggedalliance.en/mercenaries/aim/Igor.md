## Description

It won't be easy for Igor to follow in his uncle's footsteps, as Ivan Dolvich enjoys a legendary reputation.  
Igor is new to A.I.M., but by no means a novice when it comes to armed combat—he developed his cunning and craftiness on raids in the Czech Republic.  
Above all, his lineage speaks volumes about his potential.

Additional Notes: Igor and Ivan are already considered the Russian I-Team.
