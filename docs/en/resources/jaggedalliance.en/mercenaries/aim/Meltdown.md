This mercenary is legendary; a foe once dropped dead from fear before she could even properly aim.  
As for her taste in weapons—the bigger, the better. She tends toward ruthless decisiveness in everything she does.

Additional Notes: Jessop is notably ambidextrous; she can fire two weapons simultaneously with ease.
