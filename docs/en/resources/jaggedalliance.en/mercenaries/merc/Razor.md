## Description

Only Razor's love of detail and finesse with knives kept him from being called Butcher.  
Asked why he prefers a knife to a gun, he answers: "Too much noise, too little challenge!"  
He prides himself on carving the alphabet—at least the vowels—into his victims before they bleed out.

Additional Notes: Lamont has occasionally been advised to see a psychiatrist. He already holds a diploma—one in killing.
