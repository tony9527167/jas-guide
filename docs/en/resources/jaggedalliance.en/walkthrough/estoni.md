# JA2 Walkthrough - I6 Estoni Junkyard

Estoni consists of a garage with a workshop, a junkyard, and a house.  
There are no enemies stationed in this sector. If you do encounter a patrol passing through, deal with them as in other sectors—simply eliminate them all.  
After freeing Shank from Tixa and hiring him, and then speaking with Jake (3), Jake will sell you fuel. This allows Estoni to be used as a base for the helicopter.

1. [Maddog](../mercenaries/rpcs/Maddog.md) may be a psycho and not exactly my favorite mercenary—since I don't like having psychos on the team—but he can be useful for other tasks (e.g., standing around at Toni's, etc.) and should therefore be considered for recruitment. Ultimately, it's up to each player to decide.

2. Skipper searches the junkyard for useful items but claims there's nothing left to find.  
   If you give him something (e.g., alcohol, rubber band, etc.), he will hand over a code card to open the door in Orta that leads to the basement.

3. Jake sells all sorts of odds and ends. Sometimes he also has useful items like Kera plates, Compound 18, tools, etc. In addition, as mentioned, he sells fuel for vehicles once Shank has been freed.
