# JA2 Walkthrough - Drassen

## B13 Drassen - Airport

Arulco's only airport outside of [Meduna](./meduna.md) is here. Liberating it pays off double: First, you finally have a weapons supplier (Bobby Ray's under the AIM links), second, there's a mine in Drassen D13 that puts money in our coffers. So let's go!

NPCs: Pablo, Waldo  
RPCs: None

Things heat up again here! This is the first sector where you can pull off real tactical masterpieces.

But now to the sector:

![B13 Sector](/public/jaggedalliance.de/walkthrough/b13_sektor.jpg)

Split your team; the slightly larger part takes the path to the right, the other grabs the wire cutters and cuts through the chain-link fence...  
Once they've reached one of the houses, have them hold position until the other group is in place. This team should crouch or go prone and stay well hidden behind the trees at position I. Once everyone's ready and no enemies spotted, go for it. One team member at I. fires into the empty air; enemies storm to the noise source. No problem for your well-entrenched folks. Always aim for the torso; a head-shot is still utopian with handguns (unless the enemy is right in front of you). The second team should now head to the small airplane; always set to "duck walk." As soon as one spots the enemy behind the plane, everyone goes prone. The enemy is very hard to hit. One merc should stand up and run (R key) until only 4 APs left, then prone. Repeat until the entire dashed line is covered. Should take max 3 turns. Then entrench behind the "satellite dish" and engage the enemy.

By now, the other team should have cleared the barriers and advance to III. The last enemy should be lurking there.  
Bravo, you've conquered your first town sector!

But we're not done yet! In the hangar far left, meet Pablo. He'll handle our packages later. He tips right away: If we don't pay him off, stuff from our orders vanishes. But since we're against bribery on principle, nothing doing. If stuff still goes missing (your pickup merc comments), threaten Pablo first, then punch him in the nose, and he'll cough up your gear (plus compensation).

![B13 Waldo](/public/jaggedalliance.de/walkthrough/b13_waldo.jpg)

In the hangar upper middle, find Waldo the mechanic. He tells of a helicopter pilot roaming the swamps. Skyrider is Arulco's only pilot not drafted by the army AND willing to work for you. He's in sectors B13, B15, C16, E14, or D12. Once found, persuade him with your highest leadership merc to escort to Drassen. There he'll be available for flights. He also reveals the first SAM Site: east of Drassen Mine.

Plan route to Drassen C13.

## C13 Drassen - Town

This sector offers a mini quest and resident tips. There's also a bar that becomes important later. Let's check it out...

NPCs: Doreen, Herve, (sometimes) Father, Carmen  
RPCs: (sometimes) Devin

![C13 Sector](/public/jaggedalliance.de/walkthrough/c13_sektor.jpg)

OK, let's go. Place one or two at position I., others on the street. Immediate interruption: one or two enemies at I. They shouldn't be standing after your turn. Otherwise, duck and hope...

The other team advances and splits. Half right, half left. Right team prone to trees before spotted. Left team to tree cover too; enemies come one by one. Hot firefight ensues.

Once all enemies plated, enter houses and talk to civilians. Tips rain down.

![C13 Tip1](/public/jaggedalliance.de/walkthrough/c13_tip1.jpg)

![C13 Tip2](/public/jaggedalliance.de/walkthrough/c13_tip2.jpg)

The last shows we should check the warehouse bottom right... and sure enough: Doreen forces kids to work. Can't let that slide. Your AE should have enough leadership to convince Doreen (via endless threats...). Or shoot her; she drops key to room at warehouse end with useful loot. Lock can be picked or blown too; your call.

![C13 Doreen](/public/jaggedalliance.de/walkthrough/c13_doreen.jpg)

The truly hardcore follow Dr. Kill's tip: Convince Doreen nicely first, then blast her (double holds better, +2% extra loyalty). Max laughs if Buzz shoots her; she assumes affair with her ex (Lynx) ;-).

On to Drassen D13...

## D13 Drassen - Mine

"Tag, you're it—I'm spring" style: Split team, peek around house corners. Let imagination run wild...

NPCs: Peter, (sometimes) Mickey, Father  
RPCs: (sometimes) Devin

![D13 Sector](/public/jaggedalliance.de/walkthrough/d13_sektor.jpg)

So, split team again, action! One left team, preferably SMG-armed, runs to house and roof. Prone there, wait. Other two prone in tall grass ahead, stay.

![D13 Grizzly](/public/jaggedalliance.de/walkthrough/d13_grizzly.jpg)

Right team entrench at trash can. Now left team fires shot in air; all enemies charge, engage grass team. Trash can crew eliminates spotted foes.

Rooftop shooter SMGs some to hell. Once all enemies schooled, congrats: First town liberated!

But not done; more to do... Visit Father in church; if not, check C13 bar. Promises food for rebels.

![D13 Peter](/public/jaggedalliance.de/walkthrough/d13_pater.jpg)

Also find mine foreman Fred in bottom-left office. Besides useful stuff, happy to hand daily earnings. We'll TAKE that!!!

Now train militia with team. Vital in every sector. Also medically treat all mercs (Ira can), repair gear if possible.

![D13 Fred](/public/jaggedalliance.de/walkthrough/d13_fred.jpg)

Once tended, have assault team mix up Drassen roamers; they pack shotguns, SMGs, rifles. Be careful. But worth it...
