# JA2 Walkthrough - Cambria

## F8 Cambria – Hospital

Enemies: about 8

![F8 Sector](/public/jaggedalliance.de/walkthrough/f8_sektor.jpg)

RPC: 1 (Vince, the doctor. He joins if the Joey quest is completed and Cambria's loyalty is at least 80%. He has high wisdom but poor marksmanship.)

NPCs: 2 (or 3) – Nurse Jenny and another doctor, both needed if you want your mercenaries treated in the hospital. (In Sci-Fi mode there is a third NPC, crippled by the bugs, but he has no further role.)

Special: Mercenaries can be treated here for a fee. Do not loot the medical storage, or medical help will be refused.

Tactics: Best to attack from the west. One squad climbs onto the roof to occupy the troops, while a second squad enters through the front door.

## F9 Cambria – University

Enemies: about 8  
RPC: none  
NPC: none

Special: In the student dorms you often find grenades (including 40mm or mortar grenades). In the hole in the south wall of the cafeteria there is a mine that cannot be detected, so avoid entering through it.

Approach:  
Enter from the west and deploy mercenaries at the bottom edge of the map. Then climb onto the roof of the university.

Crawl carefully northward to avoid being spotted by guards on the west side of the building, then move west once above the cafeteria.

Set up camp above the passage between cafeteria and laboratory. If no enemies appear, fire a loud shot into the dark to draw them out.

Enemies will then pass by one after another and can be eliminated. If none appear after some time, check north (yellow circle), where some may be hiding.

## G9 Cambria – City

NPC: Keith – buys and sells cheap items, even used LAWs (but has only $1500 per day). He buys weapons only after the Hillbilly problem (G10) is solved. In one house there is also a man who repairs damaged items for money.  
RPC: none

![G9 Sector](/public/jaggedalliance.de/walkthrough/g9_sektor.jpg)

Tactics:  
Attack from the north (starting point north of the central flat-roofed building). Move unseen to the house, climb up, and lie down at the roof edge. Fire a shot to lure Deidranna's soldiers. Then rise, shoot, and lie down again during the enemy's turn. This way you can safely convince most of the enemy troops to meet their end.

If enemy numbers dwindle, carefully check the shop beneath you—sometimes one hides there. (Tip: let an experienced merc climb down by a window to trigger an interrupt.) If the house is clear but the sector is not yet liberated, a stubborn enemy may be south of the central building.

Note: In the police station to the east you sometimes find a full set of Spectra gear. After several attempts with lockpicks or explosives, the door will open.

## G8 Cambria – City

Location: G8  
Terrain: light forest, city  
Civilians: yes  
Militia: yes  
Level: 1  
Quest: Joey quest

![G8 Sector](/public/jaggedalliance.de/walkthrough/g8_sektor.jpg)

Start: Deploy mercenaries at START.  
Points 1–4: see text.  
H1: Martha's house.

This solution was written after Cambria was already liberated, while attempting to beat Scharfi's record.

From START move to 1. Shoot enemies on the purple-marked street (do not get too close). Then move to 2 and again eliminate enemies on the purple street until none remain.

Now split the team:

- Snipers with long-range rifles go onto the roof of H1.
- Assault fighters (e.g., Maddog) cross the street and clear the houses.

Advance to 4. If the sector is still not liberated, search the forest in the northern part of town—sometimes a redshirt hides there.

Once the sector is free, talk to Martha in H1. She explains her son has run away and asks you to bring him back. This begins the Joey quest.

## H8 Cambria – Mine

NPC: a mine foreman  
RPC: none  
Enemies: 8–12 (possibly Mike)

![H8 Sector](/public/jaggedalliance.de/walkthrough/h8_sektor.jpg)

Special: The Cambria mine is one of the richest.

Tactics:  
Start at the middle of the upper map edge. Usually an enemy waits there—eliminate him quietly. Then sneak to the mine building and climb onto its roof. At the roof edge, fire a shot into the dark. Soon Deidranna's soldiers will arrive and be killed.

After the main group is dead, climb down and search for the last 2–3 enemies. Throw glow sticks west and south to spot them from a distance, giving you more time to kill them before they see you.
