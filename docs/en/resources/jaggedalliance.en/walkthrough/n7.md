# JA2 Walkthrough - N7 Meduna Barracks/Prison

In sector N7 you'll find one of Deidranna's army barracks as well as her infamous "playroom." It's worth a visit because:

- The soldiers here are well equipped, and you can loot plenty of gear.
- Numerous crates contain useful items—finding 7 LAWs is not unusual.

## Strategy – Direct Assault

Enter the sector at night from the north. Since the compound has two entrances, split your mercenaries into three squads:

- Squad 3: positioned in the middle of the sector. One merc should carry wire cutters.
- Squads 1 & 2: placed to the left and right of Squad 3, halfway to the map edges.

Squads 1 and 2 advance slowly toward the entrances, staying in forest cover. The gate guards are illuminated, while your mercs remain hidden in the dark—making them easy targets. Once the entrances are secured, Squad 3 moves south.

- Southwest: the barracks.
- Southeast: Deidranna's playroom.

Cut the fence, advance to the tree line, and secure the courtyard. Then Squads 1 and 2 can safely enter through the gates.

- The western squad clears the barracks (usually 1–2 soldiers).
- The eastern squad takes the playroom.

If enemies remain, Squad 3 should check the southern warehouse. Looting crates and cabinets requires someone with explosives skill, since some items are booby-trapped.

## Alternative Strategy – "Capture Route"

For those who prefer a different challenge:

1. First conquer Alma and Tixa.
2. Then send 2–3 well-trained mercs (melee, martial arts, or knife skills are helpful) into an enemy sector where the enemy outnumbers you.
3. Approach a soldier openly instead of shooting. He will taunt you and offer surrender. Accept it.

About a day later, you'll find yourself in sector N7, inside Deidranna's playroom.

Prepare for a "high-profile visit": Deidranna herself arrives, accompanied by Joe (her torturer) and Elliot. After their departure, Elliot forgets to lock the door.

From the cell room, pick up a knife and silently eliminate the guard. The hardest part is reaching the eastern side of the warehouse. A small attached room contains several crates—your equipment is inside the crate to the right of the door. Avoid enemy contact at all costs; with only a guard's Beretta and a knife, you stand little chance against elite soldiers. Once you recover your gear, it's back to "business as usual."

This sector offers both a straightforward tactical assault and a unique scripted encounter, making it one of the more memorable battles in Meduna.
