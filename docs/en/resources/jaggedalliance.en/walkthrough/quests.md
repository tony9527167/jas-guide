# JA2 – Quests

In _Jagged Alliance 2_ there are several hidden quests. They are optional—you can complete the game (killing Deidranna) without them—but they are worthwhile. Most reward you with either money or loyalty. Since there is no fixed order (quests trigger depending on which towns you liberate first), they are listed by the towns where their starting points are found.

## Omerta – The Letter Quest

Right at the intro you receive the first quest: Enrico hands you a letter for Miguel.  
In the drop zone sector (A9) you meet Fatima. Give her the letter—she reads it and leads you to Miguel. Contact with the rebels is valuable: you get four free mercenaries (first Ira and Dimitri, later Miguel and Carlos).

As thanks for delivering the letter, you can recruit Ira. She's not a top mercenary at first, but:

- She trains militia well.
- She can serve as a temporary doctor.
- With Wisdom 83 she learns quickly.
- And, as the saying goes, "don't look a gift horse in the mouth."

Miguel then gives you the next quest.

## Omerta – The Food Quest

The rebels in Omerta are starving. Miguel asks you to bring food.  
Travel to Drassen and talk to Father Walker. He's usually found in a bar rather than his church (C13, D13). He promises to divert some of the collection to the rebels.

If you give him 2–3 bottles of beer, he'll share stories of Deidranna's atrocities and eventually mention nurse Jenny Walden in Cambria's hospital.

Return to Omerta a few days later and Miguel rewards you with Dimitri. He's forgetful and not very bright, but his throwing knives are excellent for quietly eliminating soldiers when stealth is needed.

## Drassen – The Child Labor Factory

![Quests Doreen](/public/jaggedalliance.de/walkthrough/quests_doreen.gif)

Talking to Drassen's citizens reveals another quest: in sector C13, children are forced to work in a factory.  
Send a merc with high leadership to speak with Doreen, the factory manager. She can be convinced to leave, which raises Drassen's loyalty.

If you then execute her (after she has left the factory, so the children don't witness it), loyalty rises again.  
Use the key she drops to unlock the back room, where you'll find loot such as E-Boosters, R-Boosters, 9mm magazines, and an HK MP5-K.

## Drassen – Skyrider

![Quests Skyrider](/public/jaggedalliance.de/walkthrough/quests_skyrider.gif)

At Drassen's airport (B13) sits a brand-new helicopter. To use it, you need a pilot.  
Waldo, the aircraft mechanic, tells you about someone hiding in the nearby swamps. You must search several possible sectors (B13, B15, C16, D12, E14).

When you bring Skyrider back to the helicopter in Drassen, he will fly you across Arulco for a small fuel fee—hugely increasing your mobility.

These quests add depth and rewards to the campaign, making your fight against Deidranna smoother and more engaging.

## Alma – Bloodcat Quest

![Quests Auntie](/public/jaggedalliance.de/walkthrough/quests_auntie.gif)

In the mining district of Alma (I14), Auntie explains that Alma's children are often used as meals for the Bloodcats. Recognizing the danger, you gather hollow-point ammo, automatic weapons, and as many mercs as possible, then march to I16.

- Bloodcats are best fought with burst fire—they're large and easy to hit.
- Among their leftovers you'll often find a decent rifle.
- Collect pelts, teeth, and claws—Mickey pays well for them.

Return to Alma and report back to Auntie to increase local loyalty.

## Alma – Freeing Dynamo

![Quests Dynamo](/public/jaggedalliance.de/walkthrough/quests_dynamo.gif)

The mine foreman in Alma, Matt, tells you his brother Dynamo is imprisoned in Tixa. Free Dynamo, listen to his story, then recruit him.  
Bringing him back to Matt triggers an emotional reunion and earns loyalty points.

## Cambria – The Inbred Farm

In Cambria (G9), Keith explains that the town is terrorized by deranged farmers. Their farm is in sector F10.

- After clearing them out, check the shed crates and the fridge—expect good weapons, gear, and beer.
- Once word spreads of their defeat, Cambria's loyalty rises.

If you're under-equipped, bring a female merc. Daryl may propose marriage, trading weapons for her. The farmers then fall to their own arms.

## Cambria – The Runaway Boy

In Cambria G8, Martha tells us she misses her son Joey. She mentions a few places he might be, and logically, he's in San Mona, where only "sex, alcohol, and trouble" are to be expected.
Joey is either in C5, spying through the window into the brothel, or he's in the mine (D4) looking at "gynecological journals." If you speak to him directly, he grumbles and lets you take him home, which increases his loyalty in Cambria. Now you get one free treatment at the hospital and a 20% discount. You can also recruit Vince, the doctor at the hospital, which I personally find morally reprehensible. Drafting 50% of the doctors in a poor developing country into the army is unacceptable.

It's true, by the way, that Martha will have a heart attack and die if Joey is shot in front of her. However, since that's bad for loyalty, it's best to avoid doing it.

## Chitzena – The Tourists

In Chitzena (A2), you find two lost tourists, John and Mary Kulba. Escort them to Drassen's airport and they give you their vacation money ($2000). A few days later, they add two Automags to your arsenal.

## Chitzena – The Holy Grail

The ruins' guardian in Chitzena (A2), Yanni, explains that Deidranna stole the "Chalice of Chance." It's displayed in Balime (L12) museum.

- Killing the guard Eldin hurts Balime's loyalty, so instead talk to him—he reveals his working hours.
- After closing, enter the museum, go through the door behind the chalice into the security room, and disable the alarm.
- Return the chalice to Yanni to raise loyalty across all of Arulco.

## San Mona – Olé, Off to the Brothel

In San Mona (C6), Angel tells you his sister wants to leave prostitution. Naturally, you help.  
Go to C5 and speak with "Madame." Choose a girl, and the doorman lets you in. In the wing with the working rooms, the left-hand room contains the key and alarm switch for the back door. Take the key, disable the alarm, then head to Maria's room (at the end of the hall), conveniently located next to the back door.

In exchange for rescuing his sister, Angel gives you:

- A stylish leather jacket (latest Arulco fashion).
- Information on Kingpin's stash.
- His leather shop.

You can either keep the shop or deliver the deed to Kyle in C5 for $10,000.

## San Mona – Shopping Trip

In San Mona (C5), Tony the arms dealer resides. He's highly valuable, but Hans won't let anyone in if witnesses are present.  
To get rid of the nagging customer, give her the videotape (found in a house or the brothel). Leave the shop briefly, and Tony becomes accessible.

## San Mona – The Holy Grail

Yanni isn't the only one who wants the chalice—Kingpin does too.

Go to D5 in the evening. In the bar, Darren challenges your mercs to boxing matches. Winning is easy with brass knuckles and E-Boosters (no doping tests here). Using tear gas or mines is possible but hardly "fair play." After three victories, Kingpin invites you and offers $20,000 for the chalice.

Delivering the chalice to Kingpin lowers loyalty across Arulco. It's better to kill him—you still get the $20,000 and avoid assassin trouble later.

## Meduna – The Missing Professor

After a few in-game days, Elliot reports to Deidranna that a scientist has disappeared.  
Madlab can be found in E4, H7, H16, or I11. In his house, a cabinet switch opens the door to his secret barn laboratory. For a video camera and a rifle, he builds a robot. Its accuracy is poor, but it's durable and useful for exploration.

## The Terrorists

In bars (G9, C5, C13), you may meet Carmen, the bounty hunter. He pays $10,000 per terrorist head.

Terrorists can appear in sectors B2, C6, F9, G1, G2, G8, H14, I14, L11. Suspicious NPCs with names, especially near weapon crates, are likely terrorists. Not all appear in every game—only the pharmacist in Grumm (H2) is guaranteed.

Kill terrorists carefully—avoid head-shots, as Carmen requires intact heads. To collect a head, equip a merc with a machete, click on the corpse, and the merc will harvest it. Deliver the head to Carmen, and he pays after 24 hours. If you need to locate him, ask Jenny, the nurse in Cambria.

![Quests Terry](/public/jaggedalliance.de/walkthrough/quests_terry.gif)

Possible terrorists:

- "Terry" Slay: F9, I14, G1, G2, G8 (random; recruitable with special patch).
- "Annie" Matron of Mayhem: I14, C6, B2, L11, G8 (random).
- "Chris" The Imposter: G1, F9, L11, G8, G2 (random).
- "Joe" Tiffany: I14, G2, H14, C6, B2 (random).

- Sammy "Charlie" Elgin: H2 (always present).

## The Yellow Pages of Arulco – Where to Get What

Notes

- Devin and Micky are available in bars from about 10:00 AM until midnight. They change bars every few days.
- Each merchant has a daily purchase limit. If you sell items to them, the limit increases by that amount.
- Merchants without a daily limit only sell, not buy.
- Merchant inventories improve if you shop with them regularly.

This overview helps you plan where to stock up on weapons, gear, or quirky items across Arulco.
