# JA2 Walkthrough - D15 Drassen SAM Site

Pack essentials: Wire cutters, throwing knives.

Enter the sector at night from the south. A good knife thrower (e.g., Dimitri) sneaks east then toward the back wall of the house. Always stay outside the tank barriers—don't get too close to the actual rocket grounds. Sometimes encounter a soldier en route; eliminate him discreetly.

East of the path is a lamppost (at the gate); on the other side of the path are some trees and tall grass. The other mercs hide between the trees and in the grass, facing the lamppost.

Once Dimitri is in position, fire once toward the lamppost (Important: don't use a silenced weapon). Alarmed by the shot, all guards rush over. They run through the lamppost beam, so you see them while the soldiers can't spot your mercs in the dark: happy target practice.

Meanwhile, Dimitri sneaks to the fence, cuts a hole at the house's back wall, and climbs onto the roof. There's a sniper there, but he's oblivious, mesmerized watching his colleagues get perforated. How Dimitri takes out the sniper is up to him—let imagination run wild.

After clearing the forward area this way, check the gun emplacements closer. Usually 2-3 soldiers hiding among them.

Definitely worth staying a few days on the rocket grounds with your mercs and not leaving militia training to Biff or Flo. After ~1 day, 6 blackshirts attack, and a few days later, more heavy counterattacks. So don't move the A-Team until 20 blue militia are trained.

Solution by Marco "DarkMagic" Torkler:

The SAM Site near Drassen, which should be captured first, is in sector D15.

Best to attack with 2-3 squads from different directions. Send 2-3 good snipers with wire cutters from sector D16 to cut a hole in the fence like in the image below, all without being seen.

Because if spotted, the soldier immediately radios colleagues. Once snipers on the roof, handle the troops sent from E14. Best to keep them in tree cover because enemies swarm the entrance! Overall, you'll face about 15-20 enemies who aren't super heavily armed or well-armored, but numbers make it tough! If attacking with three squads, send the third from D14.

These mercs also take position behind trees and crawl forward slowly.

Once the first shots are exchanged, the roof snipers can engage and target enemies coming from the rocket towers. Once all enemies outside are "taken around the corner," there might be one hiding inside, but he shouldn't be much trouble!

When looting items, **CAUTION**: The crates in the building are electronically trapped!

But the SAM Site is taken. Now grab your best trainer and quickly build a strong militia, as Deidranna will definitely try to reconquer the SAM Site soon!
