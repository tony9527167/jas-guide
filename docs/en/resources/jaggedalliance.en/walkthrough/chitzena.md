# JA2 Walkthrough - Chitzena

## B2 Chitzena - Town

![B2 Sector](/public/jaggedalliance.de/walkthrough/b2_sektor.jpg)

Here you can see that I'm working with two 2-merc squads. One squad starts more to the left to push from left to center. The other squad stumbles in from the right, right in front of a tree line where the first enemy was already standing. Since he didn't see us—he had his back to the mercs—we could take him out easily. With the right duo squad, I then went into cover behind the trees for now.  
The left squad works its way up to the first two houses and takes cover there initially. At the same time, you can sneak one from the right squad to the mine house, where you'll likely meet heavy resistance. So use the other as a sniper beforehand; enemy units will shoot at the visible merc, allowing you to dodge right behind the house. If the guards chase, they enter the firing range of the other merc posted in the woods. Once enemies there are eliminated, push on to the center to pinch the enemy units.  
Behind the houses, prepare for nasty surprises. At this point, pull mercs from the left to distract the guards; after a few shots, they'll turn and chase the merc. Then you have a great opportunity, as the mercs at the mine house only need a few steps to get the enemies in front of the barrel.  
It might happen that you've cleared the sector already—in this example, it was the case. But it can always go differently since enemies move and learn. So always advance cautiously and secure against attacks constantly.

After all are eliminated, talk to Calvin in the mine house; he'll promise to work for you from now on. If you're short on cash, head underground afterward and pick up the silver nuggets lying around.

## A2 Chitzena - Ruins

![A2 Sector](/public/jaggedalliance.de/walkthrough/a2_sektor.jpg)

This town sector has unusually many enemies. Use the houses for cover and work forward slowly; again, best with the two 2-merc squad system. Let one group hug the wall closely, best kneeling; once right at the wall, you'll hit the enemy and just need to prone the merc to best exploit cover. Since the enemy is out in the open here, you can even take your time. The other squad should, if possible, pop out of cover once, fire a shot, hope it hits, and seek cover again. Always save beforehand first (_pfff_ only noobs save ;-) Ed. note), or you might get a nasty surprise:

In this example, you see three mercs at the trees and two between the houses. When that many are bunched, they usually go first; as soon as you pop out, so best call the other squad to surprise them. Once done here, climb over the wall and work forward carefully.  
You'll likely meet the last enemy in this sector here. Otherwise, check behind ruins and statues—the cowards hide there too....

Once finished, talk to Yanni the ruins caretaker. He'll get all sentimental and talk about a Goblet of Glory stolen from Chitzena.

![A2 John](/public/jaggedalliance.de/walkthrough/a2_john.jpg)

Also in this sector are tourists Mary and John Kulba from Cleveland. They wanted a vacation but flew to Arulco by mistake. These village bumpkins will beg you to escort them to Drassen Airport.  
Reward: $2,000 and a few days later, the Auto-mag III shipped. A beefed-up pistol for 7.62mm ammo that packs a punch.
