# JA2 Walkthrough - Balime

## L12 Balime – Museum/Shops

If you enter this sector from the east, split your five-man squad into two groups:

- A two-man team with strong nerves and good weapon skills.
- A three-man team that moves toward the northwest gate, lying down just before reaching it to avoid detection.

One merc from the three-man team should sprint to the first row of trees. From the last tree onward, he should sneak along the wall and lie down in stealth mode. Soon, an enemy will approach—your merc gets the first move. You can eliminate him with a suppressed pistol, a throwing knife, or simply shoot him with a rifle. It's best to wait until all mercs are in position before opening fire.

The two mercs with strong nerves should be stationed between the two houses, using the central tree and the bush near the left house for cover. Ivan or a merc with at least 92 marksmanship (like Shadow) is recommended. Once Dimitri fires his rifle, enemies rush forward and often run straight into Ivan's sights. While the southern mercs engage, the gate team should attack simultaneously.

After most enemies are defeated, clear out the remaining few hiding north and northwest of the museum to secure the sector.

Balime is a trading town. Shops include:

- **Franz Hinkle's electronics store**: sells armor at good prices, most needing only repairs. Also sells the robot's camera.
- **Sam Rozen's tool shop**: offers cheap ammunition and items like wire cutters.
- **Howard Filmore's pharmacy**: provides regeneration boosters and medical supplies.  
  Balime also has all the parts needed to build the X-ray device (except the tube).

The museum houses the "Chalice of Chance," which can be delivered to Yanni in Chitzena or Kingpin in San Mona. Eldin Fiddes, the museum guard, complicates matters. He works from 07:00 to 22:00. Options:

![L12 Museum](/public/jaggedalliance.de/walkthrough/l12_museum.jpg)

1. **Daytime distraction:** Line up mercs so Eldin stays in the room. Dimitri can trigger the alarm and grab the chalice, but avoid Eldin's line of sight or he'll attack. Exit quietly.
2. **Night stealth:** Use Shadow in sneak mode. Pass the chalice, enter the left door, disable the alarm with the red switch, grab the chalice, and leave. Close the door behind you to cover your tracks.
3. **Aggressive method:** Shoot Eldin with a shotgun. Downside: trained militia will attack you and town loyalty will drop sharply.

## L11 Balime – Residential Area

![L11 Sector](/public/jaggedalliance.de/walkthrough/l11_sektor.jpg)

This sector is fairly simple. Enter from the northeast and split your team:

- A strong three-man squad (Ivan, Raven, AE).
- Dimitri and Static provide rear support, moving toward the western house.

The three-man squad encounters heavy resistance near the first northeast house. Dimitri or Static can simultaneously enter through the back door for a surprise attack.

After the fight, move the trio into the bushes near the house entrance and wait for Dimitri and Static to reach their positions. They should scout from north to west, eliminating enemies. Once positioned, they cover the last house while the main team advances. Beware of hidden windows—stay close to the opposite wall for safety.

![L11 Path](/public/jaggedalliance.de/walkthrough/l11_path.jpg)

Ivan should sneak to the tree and lie down. The rest sneak to the southern side of the house, avoiding windows. Save progress frequently.

Doors may be booby-trapped. Use a merc with high experience and explosives skill to disarm traps. Options for opening doors include force, locksmith kit, crowbars, or bare hands. Always disarm traps first. Once safe, open normally or with locksmith kit.

After Static disarms the trap, Ivan sneaks to the upper door. If the lower door is open, Ivan can make noise at the upper door to distract enemies.

![L11 Tuer](/public/jaggedalliance.de/walkthrough/l11_tuer.jpg)

Enemies will turn toward the noise, exposing their backs.

![L11 Haus](/public/jaggedalliance.de/walkthrough/l11_haus.jpg)

Use this opportunity to eliminate them from behind. Continue carefully through the house, sending your most experienced merc first to maximize chances of getting the first move.

In the first house, you'll find **Armand and Lora Ricci**. If you threaten Armand, he will even give you money.
