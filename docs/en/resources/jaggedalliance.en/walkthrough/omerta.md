# JA2 Walkthrough - Omerta

## A9 Omerta - Town

Well, you've created your alter ego, hired your team, and now want to see some action?  
Then get ready—Arulco is a hot spot!

You've been dropped off by helicopter in A9, a sector in Omerta. Omerta consists of only 2 sectors (A9, A10) and was completely devastated by Deidranna's troops, as they suspect it's the rebels' hideout. Enrico said you'd find Miguel here, so let's go look for him!

NPCs: Pacos and Fatima

X = possible enemy positions  
---> (red) = possible path the enemies take once shots are fired  
---> (blue) = path your team should take

1.Your team was dropped off here by helicopter. The team should quickly and crouched head to 2, otherwise you're a good target for the northwestern enemy.

2.Once here, wait crouched until the first enemy from the northwest appears and take him down, causing the other enemies to approach your position.  
 Position your team as in the example: One covers south, one east, and the rest watches the door of the house (a) in front of you, as the southern enemies usually approach through house (a).

![Example](/public/jaggedalliance.de/walkthrough/a9_beispiel.jpg)

The eastern enemy will stop and shoot at you as soon as he sees your team, but that's not too bad since he's usually only armed with a pistol whose range is too short to be dangerous unless he gets a lucky hit. To take him out, wait until he's in your weapon range or use rifles and SMGs with greater range than pistols.  
The southern enemies appearing in or east of house (a) should also be no problem, as you can simply mow them down with unaimed shots due to the short distance.

Then continue south through a bombed-out house (b) into the next house (c). As soon as you exit house (c) through the southern door, you'll usually spot the last enemy, whom you can persuade to leave this world with a few 9mm full metal jacket rounds, and the first sector should be cleared.  
Then head to 3.

3.When you talk to Pacos, he just says his mother forbade him from talking to strangers and runs to 4, where his mother is.

4.Fatima, Pacos's mother, is here. Give her Enrico's letter, and she'll lead you to the rebels. Follow her to 5.

5.If you've followed Fatima here, she'll continue to A10—follow her there with your team.

## A10 Omerta - Rebel Camp

NPCs: Fatima, Pacos  
RPCs: Miguel, Carlos, Dimitri (all recruitable later), Ira

![A10 sector](/public/jaggedalliance.de/walkthrough/a10_sektor.jpg)

After following Fatima further, you meet Dimitri, who immediately snaps at Fatima for bringing us here. But no need to worry. After a few seconds, you'll find yourself in the rebel camp... and get a warm welcome:

Miguel, the leader of the rebel movement, now explains the full extent of the tragedy. The rebels need food and our help.  
OK, let's go—quickly recruit Ira and head to Drassen!

![A10 Carlos](/public/jaggedalliance.de/walkthrough/a10_carlos1.jpg)

In the crates in the upper section of the house, you'll find some useful items, sometimes TNT, mostly ammo for a weapon you don't have right now (Murphy's Law strikes here too).

In the map screen, plan a route to Drassen Airport. But prepare for a fight...
