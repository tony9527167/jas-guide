Map explanation:

- Start: Deploy mercenaries here.
- 1: One squad advances along this path toward point 3.
- 2: The other squad takes the alternate path and also meets at point 3.
- 3: Regroup here. Eliminate guards near the huts, always using trees for cover.
- 4: Enemies behind the tables are best handled by an experienced merc with smoke or explosive grenades.
- A: Stairs to the basement of Orta, where Deidranna's secret weapons factory is located.

Orta is an isolated research station where Deidranna studies Bloodcats. Behind a locked door lies the basement, housing a weapons factory producing rockets and rocket launchers.

Before entering, ensure mercs are fully rested—the march to Orta takes over three hours. The surface is heavily guarded by "specialists," armed with grenade launchers, rocket rifles, and LAWs, especially near the station entrance.

Long-range weapons (Dragunov, Steyr) are recommended, especially for daytime assaults. Night operations are generally easier.

Deploy mercs in the northeast corner and advance carefully, keeping them grouped to maximize interrupts. Use smoke grenades for cover and trees for protection. Expect one guard north of the building and another inside the station.

The guard inside is armed with a rocket rifle and often gains interrupts. With mercs of experience level 8+, you usually gain the interrupt instead. Alternatively, open the door under smoke cover and attack with grenades.

Alternative strategy (thanks to Dr. Kill):  
Enter through the back door. Toss a smoke grenade inside, wait for it to spread, then move in with two mercs. Advance west to the edge of the smoke, throw a V-grenade near the basement door, and step out.

The station leader will open the door if paid $20,000. Otherwise, use a LAW, TNT, or the code card obtained in Estoni.

## Orta – Research Building (Basement)

![K4-1 Sector](/public/jaggedalliance.de/walkthrough/k4-1_sektor.jpg)

Map explanation:

- Start: Entry point.
- 1: Advance to the armored door, position mercs, and open it.
- 2: Move to the middle of the corridor and check the right side.
- 3: Then clear the left side.
- 4: After the mustard gas alarm, the last enemy hides here. Use smoke grenades to surprise him.
- A: Ernest, the station leader, usually found here. Threaten him repeatedly to reveal the rocket launchers.
- S: Last specialist here, also holding the code card for the rear section.
- R: Six rocket launchers and ammunition stored in crates.

In the basement, burst-fire weapons are most effective. The first room contains a guard—easy to dispatch with the first move. Another may hide in the right-hand room or even the bathroom.

A switch opens the heavy door. Position mercs carefully before opening. After clearing the corridor, check both end rooms. Equip gas masks before proceeding.

Once ~6 enemies are killed, a mustard gas alarm triggers and more specialists rush out. Form a firing line and rely on interrupts. The last specialist hides behind door S, holding the code card. Beyond it are rare and valuable items.

Open the final door and confront the research leader.

He is hostile, but repeated threats force him to reveal a room with crates containing six decoded rocket launchers and rockets.

Orta is usually retaken after one week, but only the surface.
