## History

History : How it all began

The history:

It all began in 1995 with the release of "_Jagged Alliance - Battle for Metavira._"
A game whose qualities were significantly underestimated at the beginning, but which ultimately achieved great acclaim. It was eventually named Game of the Year by Power Play magazine.
The first part of the game was about liberating the island of "Metavira" from the nefarious Lucas Santino and his men. The focus was on the legendary sap of the Fallow trees, which only grow on this island. To do this, you had to fight your way through the 60 sectors of the island, piece by piece, to then face the leader of the bad guys in sector 1 in the grand finale and take him out. The whole thing was peppered with a few missions that promised additional income.
The graphics were quite simple and all the mercenaries looked the same, but the great personalities of each individual mercenary made the game captivating until the very end!

A year later, _"Jagged Alliance: Deadly Games"_ was released. This was a multiplayer Jagged Alliance and not a sequel in the true sense of the word. The graphics remained the same and only a few new mercenaries and weapons were added.
But it's still fun to play online today.
