## Q: What the heck are "F.A.Q.s" ?

A: Hello newbie. FAQs are Frequently Asked Questions - common questions like these here.

## Q: What do all these abbreviations mean?

A: JA2 - Jagged Alliance 2, the game this is all about
NPC - non-player character, so characters you can't play
RPC - Recruit-able characters, like Dynamo from the Demo
... (ask for more)

## Q: The game always crashes when .../does not start at all!!

A: Unfortunately I cannot help you with technical problems. Please contact TopWare Support directly!

## Q: How does this 16 Million Patch work?

A: Start a new game, with the settings realistic, easy and no additional guns. Save immediately after the start without changes and follow the remaining instructions in the Readme file included with the patch. Otherwise you can also get money by "hexing" it directly into a mercenary's hand using a RAM editor.

## Q: How can I edit the save-games of the Demo Ver. 1.0.0.6?

A: You can't! SirTech has encrypted the save-games from version 1.0.0.6 onwards to prevent these little games. Until the release of the full version, no one will surely take the trouble to crack this code, as it might still change.
So you need either the German Ver. 1.0.0.4 or the English Ver. 1.0.0.5 to be able to edit the save-games.

## Q: Where can I get an update to Version 1.0.0.5?

A: You can't! Unfortunately there is no update to Ver. 1.0.0.5.
So if you want to play edited save-games with the English version, you have to download the complete demo again (Ver. 1.0.0.5 is e.g. on EKI's JA2 site, but the FTP server is currently broken).

## Q: Will the German and the US version be released simultaneously in Germany?

A: NO. It looks like the German version will be released earlier (on 19.4.99). This is because SirTech has still not found a new publisher for the US market and there will be no US version until then (not even in the USA).

## Q: What about update support for the German version?

A: TopWare will probably take care of that. I don't see any problems there.

## Q: Is the ace mercenary Mike included ???

A: Yes. But as you can see in the Pics section he belongs to the NPCs and is therefore not playable! Whether he was hired by the enemy or is just on vacation in Arulco I don't know either...

## Q: What is the difference between A.I.M. and M.E.R.C. ?

A: M.E.R.C. is the new mercenary agency. It will only emerge in the course of the game and be founded by some ex-A.I.M. mercenaries. The difference is e.g. that at A.I.M. you have to pay the salary directly in advance while at M.E.R.C. you pay on account. But if you don't pay your bills, M.E.R.C. goes bankrupt and you are out of luck. If you pay regularly, there will be more (and better) mercenaries there ....

## Q: How can I copy JA2?

A: If you want to know how to (pirate) copy Ja 2, then you've come to the wrong place.
