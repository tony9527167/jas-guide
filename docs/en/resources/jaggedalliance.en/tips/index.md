# JA2 - Tactics

## Tips for Getting Started

In DOC's patent recipes, you'll learn everything you need to know to get started in JA2.  
Contents include, for example, the BSE Test, the team, equipment, and general combat tactics.

## Head-shot

Whenever it makes sense (to take out the enemy, range of the weapon used), always aim for the enemy's head. This robs them of the most action points; often their follow-up shot in the next round will miss, or they won't shoot at all.  
Sometimes a good shot is lethal. Of course, it's better if you have enough of your own APs left to withdraw, but sometimes you just have no choice...

## Play It Safe

To play it safe during interruptions and take out the enemy, you can line up several soldiers one behind the other (this applies to soldiers with few APs and weak weapons, to eliminate the enemy during the interruption). With a formation of Standing, Kneeling, Prone, all facing the same direction, they all become selectable during the interruption... that should knock the shoes off any enemy. This works especially well if the enemy can only come from one direction (e.g., a hallway) and is lured in by a noise.

## Use the Environment

In the second part of Jagged Alliance, it's become even more important to exploit the environment. Send your mercenaries into cover behind solid objects (walls, barriers, etc.) whenever possible. Due to the improved ballistics, trees and bushes provide almost no cover anymore. It's also possible for bullets to penetrate an object or a mercenary/enemy and hit the one behind it.

## Doors No. 2

Another nice tactic with doors is to position one mercenary on each side of the door so that they can spot an enemy appearing in the doorway.  
Then, alternately (in run mode), step in front of the door, fire a burst inside, and step back.  
If the enemies are very close to the door, station one mercenary to cover. A mercenary who waits most of the time will usually get an interruption if an enemy enters their line of sight.  
This should normally result in no injuries or losses on your side.

## Traps

Lure enemy soldiers into traps, and your mercenaries will thank you with minimal losses. When enemies hear suspicious noises, they usually head straight there to investigate. If their path happens to lead past a corner where your mercenary squad is lying in wait, it will probably be their last... This way, you can easily lure enemies out of buildings to their doom. But beware: the enemy isn't stupid either and will try to flank you if possible. So secure your rear with one or two mercenaries!

## Distract the Enemy

Enemy soldiers can easily be distracted with a shot or similar (or what do you think the stones are for?!), so you can then attack them from the other side with another mercenary.

## Take Cover

Always make sure that at the end of a turn, you have enough APs left to dive for cover or go prone. So, before an action, leave at least 2-4 APs for going prone, or better yet, check beforehand how many you'll need to hide behind the next cover (wall, door, etc.).

## How to Take Down the Creatures?

The best way is to line up your own mercenaries in two rows and lure the creatures with a shot. Since the beasts are so large, an interruption is guaranteed. Then unload on them in burst mode with everything the barrels can give. The L.A.W. is most effective, so it's recommended to save it for the creatures.

## Explosives

If one or more enemies are standing next to a fuel tank (or similar explosive), try shooting the tank instead of the enemy themselves. This usually drains more HP from the enemy, and possibly several enemies can be injured by the explosion at once.

## Use the Doors

If you've opened a door and there's a whole army of enemy soldiers behind it, check how many action points it takes to close the door again, and only shoot until you have just enough APs left to close it. Then close it and repeat the process until all enemies are eliminated.
