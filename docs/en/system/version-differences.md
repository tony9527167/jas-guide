# JA2 Systems - Version Differences

## The Game

The _Jagged Alliance_ series is a collection of Tactical Role-Playing Games (TRPG),
it is a long-running franchise known for its deep, turn-based tactical gameplay, strategic management layer, and memorable mercenary characters.

### Brief History of the Jagged Alliance Series

**Jagged Alliance (1995)** : Developed by _Madlab Software_ and published by _Sir-Tech_, this first installment for MS-DOS established the core gameplay loop.
Players were tasked with liberating the island of Metavira by hiring mercenaries and managing the local economy (harvesting medicinal sap) to fund their operations.

**Jagged Alliance: Deadly Games (1996)** : Developed by _Sir-Tech_, this follow-up used the same engine but focused on a series of tactical,
mission-based scenarios rather than a persistent open world campaign. It added a multiplayer mode and a map editor.

**Jagged Alliance 2 Demo (1998)** : Developed by _Sir-Tech_, a official demo of Jagged Alliance 2.

**Jagged Alliance 2 (classic) (1999)** : Developed by _Sir-Tech_ and released for Windows, this is widely considered the pinnacle of the series. It vastly expanded the scope with higher resolution graphics, an isometric 3D view, deeper RPG mechanics, and a sandbox campaign to liberate the fictional nation of Arulco from a dictator, Queen Deidranna. The classic version ran up to v1.03 (build 99.06.09).

**Jagged Alliance 2: Unfinished Business (2000)** : A standalone sequel by _Sir-Tech_ that continued the story after the main game. It featured a shorter, more action-oriented, mission-based campaign with fewer strategic elements, though it did allow character importing from JA2.

**Jagged Alliance 2 Gold Pack (2002)** : Published by _Strategy First_, this bundle included both the main game (patched to the definitive v1.12, which incorporated additional bugfixes and minor features from _Unfinished Business_) and the _Unfinished Business_ expansion. This version is often considered the ideal base for modern modding.

- **Jagged Alliance 2**, v1.12 (build 04.12.02)
- **Jagged Alliance 2: Unfinished Business**

**Jagged Alliance 2: Wildfire (2004)** : Originally a fan-made mod by Serge "WildFire" Pop-off that became a commercial product. The official version 6.04 (build 12.01.06) (by iDeal Games Studio/Zuxxez) featured a tweaked engine for higher resolutions, new maps, new items, and a higher difficulty, but largely kept the core story and engine of JA2 intact.

**Jagged Alliance 3 (2023)** : After many failed attempts by various developers over nearly two decades, _Haemimont Games_ (known for the Tropico series) released the first official mainline sequel to JA2. It modernizes the series with updated 3D graphics, a new campaign in the nation of Grand Chien, and revised mechanics, while aiming to recapture the depth and tone of the original.

### Brief History of the Jagged Alliance IP

- 1994-c. 2000: **Sir-Tech Canada**
  - The franchise was created by _Madlab Software_, which developed the first _Jagged Alliance (1994)_.
  - Madlab Software was later absorbed by its publisher, _Sir-Tech Software_, Inc., and the IP rights were transferred to them.
  - Subsequent titles, including Deadly Games, Jagged Alliance 2, and Unfinished Business, were developed by Sir-Tech's internal development house, _Sir-Tech Canada_.
  - Various companies like TalonSoft and Interplay Entertainment acted as publishers for specific games during this period.

- c. 2000-2010: **Strategy First**
  - After Sir-Tech's publishing arm went out of business and _Sir-Tech Canada_ closed in late 2003, the rights were acquired by _Strategy First_.
  - _Strategy First_ attempted to develop _Jagged Alliance 3_ (and a 3D spin-off) with various developers, including Russian-based Akella, but these projects never materialized into a released game.
  - _Strategy First_ was acquired by _Silverstar Holdings_, which faced its own financial difficulties.

- 2010-2015: **bitComposer Games**
  - In March 2010, the German company _bitComposer Games_ (now _bitComposer Interactive_) acquired the rights to the series from _Strategy First_.
  - During this period, games like _Jagged Alliance: Back in Action_ (a remake of JA2) and _Jagged Alliance Online_ were released.

- 2015-Present: **THQ Nordic** (via **Embracer Group**)
  - In August 2015, _Nordic Games_ (which later re-branded as _THQ Nordic_ after acquiring the THQ trademark) acquired the _Jagged Alliance_ IP from the bankrupt _bitComposer Entertainment AG_.
  - _THQ Nordic_, which is a subsidiary of the larger _Embracer Group_ holding company, currently owns the rights and published the critically well-received _Jagged Alliance 3_ in 2023.

### Key Differences Between Versions and Mods

JA2 Classic, Gold, and Wildfire

- **JA2 Classic**: Refers to the original 1999 release of the game and its early patches (up to v1.03).

- **JA2 Gold**: The definitive official release, patching the game to v1.12. It is primarily a bugfix compilation that ensures better compatibility with later systems and includes the Unfinished Business mini-campaign. It is the preferred base for most modern mods.

- **JA2 Wildfire**: An official re-release/expansion (v6) that functions essentially as a harder, revamped-map mod with slightly improved graphics and the option for a larger squad size (up to 10 mercs). It keeps the original story but is generally considered more difficult and perhaps less balanced than the original "**vanilla**" experience.
  - Another key difference between JA2WF and JA2 Classic/Gold is that cheat codes are not allowed in JA2WF version 6.04 (build 12.01.06).

JA2 **vanilla**, Stracciatella, 1.13 and other Mods

- **JA2 Vanilla**: Refers to the original, un-modded game as Sir-Tech intended, typically played using the **Gold version (v1.12)**.

- **Stracciatella**: This project is a source port and unofficial patch that aims to provide a more modern "vanilla" experience. It fixes hundreds of bugs present in the original game, adds support for modern operating systems and higher resolutions/widescreen displays, and includes quality-of-life improvements, all while keeping the core gameplay virtually untouched.

- **1.13 Mod**: A massive, community-driven engine upgrade and overhaul that adds a staggering amount of new content and complexity. It includes tons of new weapons, items, mercs (from JA1), a new Chance-To-Hit (CtH) system, a weather system, and deep customization options. It fundamentally changes and expands the game, often making it much harder and more complex.

- **Other Mods**: Many other total conversion mods (e.g., Deidranna Lives, Urban Chaos) are built using either the vanilla engine or the 1.13 platform, offering entirely new campaigns, stories, or settings.
