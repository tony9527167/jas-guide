# JA2 Tactical Doctrine - Overview

"Tactical Doctrine" isn't meant to imply that there is only one correct way to play. After thousands of hours with JA2 and especially Wildfire, I actually ended up discovering that there are many very different viable styles, for example:

- rushing the game as fast as possible by going straight for the Queen
- playing a long guerrilla-style campaign
- using "pocket tactics" with small, highly mobile squads
- or even never finishing the game at all and just controlling all of Arulco

A lot of these only became obvious to me because JA2 and Wildfire are so non-linear — the game really allows very different strategic approaches if you're willing to experiment. It took a lot of time, but that's also what made it so fun.

So yeah, the name might evolve, and I definitely want to reflect that variety better over time 🙂
