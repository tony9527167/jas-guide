## Attributes

Mercenary Statistics: Take a close look at a mercenary's statistics while viewing
his file. A mercenary's statistics represent his overall ability in various areas. Each
statistic ranges from 0 to 100, with 0 being pathetic and 100 being top of the line.
Some mercenaries can improve their statistics by training and field missions.
As a mercenary's statistics increase, he becomes more valuable, and therefore
demands a higher.

**SALARY** : is the amount a merc charges for his services. A merc charges different
amounts depending on whether the contract is for a day, a week, or two weeks.
A merc's salary comes directly out of your main bank account, and must be paid
in advance. (A.I.M. mercs operate on a strictly cash-up-front basis, for obvious
reasons.) Don't blow your entire wad on expensive mercs until you can afford
their exceptional talents.

**HEALTH** : represents both the physical well-being of a mercenary and the amount
of damage he can take before death. A mercenary with 100 health is in perfect
physical condition. A mercenary with 10 health could be killed by a stubbed
toe. Health also influences the overall performance of a mercenary and the
effectiveness of other statistics and skills. After all, it's hard to perform any job
well when your arm is falling off.

**AGILITY** : measures how well a mercenary reacts physically to a new situation,
whether it's a shotgun blast or a pesky mosquito. Agility affects the speed,
coordination and control a merc displays while recognizing and reacting to an
event, as well as the merc's traveling speed.

**DEXTERITY** : measures a mercenary's ability to perform delicate or precise
movements correctly. For certain skills, like medical talents, a high dexterity is
very important. Having read all the books doesn't do much good if your hands
shake during surgery.

  - throw knife to attack enemies or cows

**STRENGTH** : represents a mercenary's muscle and brawn. You'll find it particularly important in hand-to-hand combat and forcing things open.

- The mercenary can increase this attribute by punching enemies or cows.

**WISDOM** : affects a mercenary's ability to learn from experience and training.
Naturally, it also affects his interpretation of things. Highly intelligent mercs have
no difficulty mastering the inner workings of complex military items. Those not
so mentally blessed take more time to absorb the intricacies of a skill or action.
(Hey guys! Look at the funny metal pineapple with the pin in it!)

**LEADERSHIP** : measures charm, respect, and presence. Leadership affects your
mercs'performance in the field and their interactions with non-player characters.

**MEDICAL** : Since they seldom get into firefights near hospitals, injured mercs
must rely on one another for treatment. A member's medical skill represents his
current medical knowledge and ability to heal the wounded. A mercenary with
high medical skill could perform brain surgery with a can opener and a sewing kit,
while a low skilled mercenary would have trouble applying a Band-Aid correctly.

**EXPLOSIVES** : A member's explosives skill determines his ability to create, use,
and disarm explosives without blowing himself sky-high. A highly skilled merc
could disarm the most complex bomb without breaking a sweat, while an unskilled
merc might destroy the building just by trying to light a sparkler.

**MECHANICAL** : Mercenaries use all sorts of gadgets—their weapons, radios,
locks, and so on. Mechanical skill rates a merc's ability to repair damaged,
worn-out or broken items or equipment (such as vehicles), jimmy locks, and to
combine existing objects to form new ones.

**MARKSMANSHIP** : A keen eye and a steady hand contribute to the sought-after
talents of the marksman. A mercenary's marksmanship skill reflects his ability to
hit any given target with a firearm precisely.

- How mercenaries can increase this attribute
  - throw knife to attack enemies or cows
  - shoot enemies or cows

**EXPERIENCE LEVEL** : is the most important mercenary trait. It reflects the sum
of their abilities: their years in A.I.M., the amount of combat they've seen, and
how knowledgeable they are in the field. As mercenaries gain in experience, they
also gain certain benefits:

- Their ability to detect booby traps and ambushes improves.
- They become sneakier and their stealth increases.
- They are able to focus their sights on an enemy target more quickly and accurately.
- They become more effective at interrupting enemies (and avoiding being interrupted themselves).
- Their overall proficiency in field operations increases.
- Their salary increases (mind you, it's a benefit to them).
