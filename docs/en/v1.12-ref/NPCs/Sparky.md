Megan "Sparky" Roachburn

Once the great family of warfare, the Roachburn legacy name come to an end with the resignation of Megan.
The only female family member and the last to leave A.I.M., Sparky moved on to the job she always wanted, an honesty shopper for K-Mart.
Although she says the job of leaving exact change on the counter to see if the cashier rings in the sale can get a little boring,
she'll take working at the mall over the battlefield any day.
