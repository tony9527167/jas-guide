Anita "Mouse" Backman

Anita's stint with the organization was short and rather quiet.
Known for her uncanny ability to move about unnoticed, and not much else.
Mouse handed in her resignation at the same time as Dr. Margaret "Stella" Trammel.
It is our understanding that they moved to the Virgin Islands together where Backman serves as nurse/receptionist at Trammel's newly opened medical clinic.
