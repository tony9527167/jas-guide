### Notes on versions

Jagged Alliance 2 Classic vs Jagged Alliance 2 Gold[^1](https://www.gog.com/forum/general/jagged_alliance_2_classic/post8)

> The regular JA2 (sold by Strategy First) is version 1.12 (normally reserved for the Gold Pack but eh). It's standalone, and doesn't include or require any other part of the series to run.

> The JA2 Classic (sold by TopWare) is only available as a DLC for Wildfire and is version 1.03 (not even 1.07, which was the last pre-Gold build). And the base price is $2 higher.

> And no, the version tag for the installers is not correct either - 6.08 was a version exclusive to the Russian release; the latest English one is 6.04 and the latest German one is 6.06.

**NOTICE**: There are lots change between 1.07 and 1.12, such as A.I.M mercenaries optional gear, salary and bio etc.
