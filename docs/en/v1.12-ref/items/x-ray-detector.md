# v1.12 Ref - X-Ray Detector

This homemade x-ray device looks like it will actually function, flashing a vibrating x-ray pulse and crudely displaying the results on its LCD. Batteries required.

How to build it:

- X-Ray Detector = X-Ray Device + Display Unit + Batteries
- X-Ray Device = FumblePak + X-Ray Tube + Pack of Gum
- Display unit = LameBoy Display + Copper Wire
