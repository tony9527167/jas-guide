Dr. Daniel "Danny" Quinten | $1300

Doctor David Quinten is a mountaineer, skydiver, and mobile medical practitioner.
During Operation Desert Storm, he developed a reputation for jumping out of helicopters to operate on wounded soldiers that were lying out in the middle of sandy minefields.
Even more remarkably, Danny wouldn't call in evacuation until the patient was well on his way to recovery.

Additional Info: The two-handed doctor has been known to be a bit of a lone wolf.
