John "Bull" Peters | $400

A massive man of few words, John Peters lets his actions do the talking.  
Despite his time as a U.S. Army MP, he shows little respect for authority and angers easily.
In fact, he probably spent as much time in the brig as he did guarding it.
Bull is the kind of soldier who puts the grunt back in grunt work.

Additional Info: Bull packs more punch than anyone else on our roster.
