Louisa "Buzz" Garneau | $2200

Buzz Garneau's life has undergone some major changes in the past year.
She had a major falling out with Lynx; they can barely stand to be on the same planet. Her tell-all book, "Under Cover, Under Lynx," has been rejected by every publisher who's seen it.
While all of this has left her bitter, she has been able to channel her anger into her work with firearms.

Additional Info: Garneau was recently certified as a heavy weapons specialist.
