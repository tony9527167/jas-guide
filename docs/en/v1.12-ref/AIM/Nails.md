Edgar "Nails" Smorth | $1800

Edgar Smorth traded in his bike, leathers, and vest to become a full-time A.I.M. mercenary.
In the year he's been with the organization, Nails has taken advantage of his knowledge about car bombs to become a military explosives expert.
Despite his career change, he hasn't lost his combative edge or substantial belly he developed as a renegade biker.

Additional Info: Edgar has a knack for getting into inaccessible places, just as long as they aren't too small and narrow.
