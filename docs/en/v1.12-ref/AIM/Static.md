Kirk "Static" Stevenson | $2500

The years may go by, but Static barely seems to mature. His experience and laid-back nature allow Kirk to best operate under the cover of darkness. He has served his commanders well with his mechanical abilities and knowledge of electronics. And don't be deceived--although he looks like a hippie, peace and love are the furthest things from his mind.

Additional Info: Like his good friend Spider, Static can't stand the sight of insects.
