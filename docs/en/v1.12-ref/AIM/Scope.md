Sheila "Scope" Sterling | $2900

First off, a correction is in order: Sterling's previous bio mistakenly stated that she was a member of the British Special Forces when, in fact, no such service exists.
She served with the British Special Air Service (SAS). A.I.M. regrets the error and any inconvenience it may have caused.

Additional Info: Trained in urban warfare, Scope is an expert markswoman and is well-versed in night operations.
