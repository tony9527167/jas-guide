Ice Williams | $1500

The Iceman is back. After a short yet disastrous stint with one of our competitors - and we use that term loosely - Ice gained insight and wisdom on the merits of dealing with a professional organization.
Williams owes a debt of gratitude to his best friend Magic for getting him reinstated.

Additional Info: Ice's patience and friendly demeanor make him an ideal instructor. His choice of weapon is an automatic.
