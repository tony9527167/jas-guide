Fidel Dahan | $2000

Due to numerous employee complaints concerning his refusal to follow orders, Fidel "Leave me alone, I'm busy!"
Dahan was recently suspended for a thirty-day period.
Promising a changed attitude, he was returned to active duty to his proficiency with firearm, his fists, and, last but not least, explosives.

Additional Info: Fidel hasn't quite been himself lately.
