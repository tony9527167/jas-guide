Ivan Dolvich | $2950

Ivan, a former decorated Red Army Major, joined A.I.M. over three years ago.
Despite serious difficulties communicating in English, he took the mercenary world by storm, breaking all kill-rate records and tallying up the kind of stats that perhaps only he himself is capable of breaking.
Ivan himself says it best, "gun, all gun, like finger on hand."

Additional Info: In order to improve his relationship with commanders, Ivan has enrolled in an "English as a second language" course.
