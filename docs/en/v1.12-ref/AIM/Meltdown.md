Norma "Meltdown" Jessop | $800

Don't mess with Meltdown.
She may be smiling in her file photo, but that smile is certainly deceptive.
This mercenary is legendary; an enemy once died at her feet from fear before Meltdown had even raised her weapon.
As for her taste in weapons, the bigger, the better.
In fact, Meltdown has a tendency for overkill in virtually every aspect of her life.

Additional Info: Jessop is remarkably ambidextrous; she can easily fire two weapons simultaneously.
