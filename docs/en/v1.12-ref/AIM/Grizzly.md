Steve "Grizzly" Bornell | $525

A bear of a man, Grizzly Bornell carries the big guns of battle with authority.
Even though heavy weapons are his speciality, he is just as lethal when left empty-handed.
He's a soldier's soldier - all guts and no need for glory.
Not surprisingly, his combat exploits are almost always the talk of the plane ride home.
