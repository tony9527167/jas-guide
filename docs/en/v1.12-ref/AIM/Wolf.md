Peter "Wolf" Sanderson | $1400

Peter Sanderson just returned from a six-month absence. He booked off on personal leave to take an intensive physical training program and various other courses to top-off his status as a jack-of-all-trades.
Having lost over forty pounds, he's in the best shape he has ever been in and A.I.M., as a result, has gladly renewed his membership.

Additional Info: When not on assignment, Sanderson instructs a Wolverine Civil Defense unit during the evenings.
