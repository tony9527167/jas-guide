Ernie "Red" Spragg | $900

This mad, mumbling Scotsman is from the old school of explosives where your instructor would fly by in pieces and you quickly moved up the ranks.
Spragg is a survivor.
With many years of experience under his wire cutters, he takes pride in teaching those military college kids a thing or two about detonation devices.

Additional Info: Don't be thrown by Red's frantic ravings; the situation is rarely as dire as he likes to believe.
