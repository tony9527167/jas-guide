J.P. "La Malice" Viau | $1200

Jean Pierre may be a little rough around the edges, but he is extremely sharp with a blade in hand.
He acquired most of his skills while working as the head doorman at a nightclub.
Street fighting is definitely one of his strengths.
La Malice seems to have found his calling with A.I.M. though, where he has honed his talents to exquisite perfection.
