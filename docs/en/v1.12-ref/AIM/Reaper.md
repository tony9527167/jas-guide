Carl "Reaper" Sheppards | $4000

Otherwise known as The Assassin, if you come face-to-face with Carl Sheppards, chances are you're on your last breath.
The Reaper takes pride in his patience.
He strides silently and uses his stealth skills to gain easy access to his victims.
On a personal note, Carl gets a kick out of spitting in their eyes just before they die.

Additional Info: One of his former CO's described him as "too dangerous even for military service."
