Dr. Clifford "Cliff" Highball | $1,600

Cliff's health has improved considerably since he gave up alcohol and put himself on a high-fibre diet. This is great news for potential employers since it's next to impossible to find doctors with Highballs efficient combination of marksmanship and medicine.

Additional Info: We are told Highball has also turned his explosives hobby into a marketable skill.
