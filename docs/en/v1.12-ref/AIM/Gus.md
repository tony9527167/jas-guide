Gus Tarballs | $6,000

After rather heated negotiations, A.I.M. is pleased to announce that the legendary DFK annihilator, Gus Tarballs, is now a member of our ranks.
Gus's induction was delayed slightly when his mobile home slipped from its support blocks while he was in the process cleaning the septic hosing.
Fortunately, his crushed right leg has healed rather nicely.

Additional Info: Our medical staff has recently cleared heavy weapons specialist Tarballs for full active duty.
