Florence "Flo" Gabriel | $100

The daughter of vineyard workers, Florence Gabriel spent most of her childhood in Cognac, France before moving to Pittsburgh.
After setting in the U.S., she took a job as the bookkeeper to a major gun dealer where she acquired extensive knowledge on the value of firearms.
Slightly hesitant, but bright, Flo is simply priced too low to pass up.

Additional Info: Florence volunteers with illiterate adults during her spare time.
