Bill "Razor" Lamont | $150

Razor's attention to detail and finesse with a blade saved him from being nicknamed "The Butcher."
Ask him why he prefers a knife to a gun, and every time he'll say, "So much noise, so little challenge!"
He takes pride in his ability to carve the alphabet—or at least the vowels—into his victims before they bleed to death.

Additional Info: Razor Lamont has been occasionally called certifiable. And he is indeed certified—certified in killing!
