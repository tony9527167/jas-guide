Hamous | $250

Hamous had his first taste of combat in Metavira, and based on a glowing recommendation from a major client, Jack Richards, he was granted an internship with this organization, which recently expired. Regrettably, poor Hamous never did save up enough money to purchase that mini-van that he desperately wanted. So he did the next best thing and stole one just outside of Paris. Actually it was an ice cream truck and he was last seen headed towards Istanbul in it.
