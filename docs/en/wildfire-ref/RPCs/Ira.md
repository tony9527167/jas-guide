> As she states in the rebel hideout, she came to Arulco from the United States five years prior to the events of Jagged Alliance 2,
> so she could be a part of an effort to provide humanitarian aid. However, she then noticed that the country needed help to get rid of the dictator, Deidranna Reitman,
> and took up the flag of the rebels in order to do some greater good, and fight oppression.
> She is a college graduate, with a degree in the humanities.
