> Imprisoned by Deidranna after he failed to show up to a rally, due to his son's illness. Deidranna's men got to him the same day, killed his son while he watched, and threw him in prison. He was not executed because of the efforts of his brother Matt. Has every reason in the world to kill Deidranna and everyone who works for her.
