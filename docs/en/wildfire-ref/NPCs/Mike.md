# Mike

While undergoing negotiations for yet another pay increase,
Mike suddenly withdrew from the discussion when he was informed many employers had already complained about his exaggerated rates. His current whereabouts are unknown,
just like pretty much everything else about him.
The last correspondence received by this office, postmarked in a small country whose name escapes us,
contained threats we'd rather not recall. - Jagged Alliance 2 Alumni gallery.
