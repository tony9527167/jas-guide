## Bug(s)

- If you have hired Slay, Carmen will demand that you give him Slay's head; otherwise he will refuse tod do business with you.
- After you deliver Slay's head, Carmen will tell you to meet him in another bar in next day to collect the reward money. However, this triggers a dead loop: He will continue to ask for Slay's head again, even though you have already given it to him.
