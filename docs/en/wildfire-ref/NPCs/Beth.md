Beth | Mary Beth Wilkens

It is one of the most tragic turn of events we have ever had to report.
Mary Beth died last August on the steps of her apartment building at the hands of a lone gunman. After enduring months of harassment, which developed into stalking, she was surprised by a crazed mercenary groupie, as she walked up to her doorway with her arms full of groceries. Mary Beth's determination and positive attitude will remain an inspiration to us all. - Jagged Alliance 2 Alumni gallery.
