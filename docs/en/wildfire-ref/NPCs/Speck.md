Speck T. Kline

While Speck never quits fit in with the mercenary lifestyle,
his knack for repairing what was widely believed to be unrepairable made him one of our most sought-after members.
That is , perhaps, why his decision to open a competing mercenary agency come as such a surprise to this organization.
A.I.M. wishes him the best of luck, as we are all well aware, he will need it.
