Florence "Flo" Gabriel | $300

The daughter of vineyard workers, Florence Gabriel spent most of her childhood in Cognac, France, before moving to Pittsburgh.  
After settling in the U.S., she took a job as the bookkeeper for a major gun dealer, where she acquired extensive knowledge of the value of firearms. Slightly hesitant but bright, Flo is simply priced too low to pass up.

Additional Info: Florence volunteers with illiterate adults during her spare time.
