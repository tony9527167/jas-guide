Jim "Cougar" Wallace | $2800

Jim Wallace is one of the few cadets ever to get a perfect score on every final exam at military college.
Of course, it didn't hurt that his father wrote the school's military code of conduct.
He's a master at conventional mercenary skills and a pro with automatic weaponry.
Always by-the-book Cougar is highly professional, possibly M.E.R.C's top performer.

Additional Info: Even thought he's a man with strong opinions, Cougar has the military background (and discipline) to keep them to himself.
