# JA2 Wildfire Reference - Attributes Skills and Traits

## Attributes

**SALARY** : is the amount a merc charges for his services. A merc charges differing amounts depending on whether the contract is for a day, a week, or two weeks. A merc's salary comes directly out of your main bank account, and must be paid in advance. (A.I.M. Mercs operate on a strictly cash-up-front basis, for obvious reasons.) Don't blow your entire wad on expensive mercs until you can afford their exceptional talents.

**HEALTH** : represents both the physical well-being of a mercenary and the amount of damage he can take before death. A mercenary with 100 health is in perfect physical condition. A mercenary with 10 health could be killed by stubbed toe. Health also influences the overall performance of a mercenary and the effectiveness of other statistics and skills. After all, it's hard to perform any job well and when your arm is falling off.

Enemy health value range:

- 0+ Dying
- 15+ Critical you can steal his weapon at this level
- 30+ Wounded
- 45+ Poor
- 60+ Healthy
- 75+ Strong
- 90+ Excellent

**AGILITY** : measures how well a mercenary reacts physically to a new situation, whether it's a shotgun blast or a pesky mosquito. Agility affects the speed, coordination and control a merc displays while recognizing and reacting to an event, as well as the merc's traveling speed.

**DEXTERITY** : measures a mercenary's ability to perform delicate or precise movements correctly. For certain skills, like medical talents, a high DEXTERITY is very important. Having read all books doesn't do much good if your hands shake during surgery.

**STRENGTH** : represents a mercenary's muscle and brawn. You'll find it particularly important in hand-to-hand combat and forcing things open.

**LEADERSHIP** : measures charm, respect, and presence. Leadership affects your mercs' performance in the field and their interactions with non-player characters.

**WISDOM** : affects a mercenary's ability to learn from experience and training. Naturally, it also affects his interpretation of things. Highly intelligent mercs have no difficulty mastering the inner workings of complex military items. Those not so mentally blessed take more time to absorb the intricacies of skill or action. (Hey guys! Look at the funny metal pineapple with the pin in it!)...

**EXPERIENCE LEVEL** : is the most important mercenary trait. It reflects the sum of their abilities: their years in A.I.M., the amount of combat they've seen, and how knowledgeable they are in the field. As mercenaries gain in experience class, they also again certain benefits:

- Their ability to detect booby traps and ambushes improves.
- They become sneakier and their stealth increases.
- They are able to focus their sights on an enemy more quickly and accurately.
- They become more effective at interrupting enemies. (and avoiding being interrupted themselves.)
- Their salary increases. (mind you, it's a benefit to them.)

**MARKSMANSHIP** : A keen eye and a steady hand contribute to the sought after talents of the marksman. A mercenary's marksmanship skill reflects his ability to hit, precisely, any given target with a firearm.

**MECHANICAL** : Mercenaries use all sort of gadgets-their weapons, radios, locks, and so on. Mechanical skill rates a merc's ability to repair damaged, wornout or broken items or equipment (such as vehicles), jimmy locks, and to combine existing objects to form new ones.

**EXPLOSIVE** : A member's explosives skill determines his ability to create, use, and disarm explosives without blowing himself sky-high. A highly skilled merc could disarm the most complex bomb without breaking a sweat, while an unskilled merc might destroy the building just by trying to light a sparkler.

**MEDICAL** : Since they seldom get into firefights near hospitals, injured mercs must rely on one another for treatment. A member's medical skill represents his current medical knowledge and ability to heal the wounded. A mercenary with high skill could perform brain surgery with a can opener and a sewing kit, while a low skilled mercenary would have trouble applying a band-aid correctly.

**Morale** : A Mercenary' morale will decrease if you kill civilians or if they are work with someone they dislike. In such cases the mercenary also refuse to perform certain skills or deny your orders.

- Good
- Stable
- Poor
- Panic
