Cynthia "Fox" Guzzman | $625

Initially trained as an emergency room nurse, Fox Guzzman was recently featured in "Babes and Bullets", a prestigious monthly mercenary magazine.
Her article on instructing medical personnel in the proper control of battlefield hemorrhaging was almost as highly praised as her centerfold layout.
Rumor has it that Fox is equally skilled with both hands.

Additional Info: Guzzman has recently spent a lot of time on the firing range, and it has paid off handsomely.
