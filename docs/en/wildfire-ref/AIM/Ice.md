Ice Williams | $2,000

The Iceman is back. After a short yet disastrous stint with one of our competitors - and we use that term loosely - Ice gained insight and wisdom on the merits of dealing with a professional organization. Williams owes a debt of gratitude to Magic for getting him reinstated.

Additional Info: Ice's patience and friendly demeanor make him an ideal instructor. His choice of weapon is an automatic.
