Luc "Lucky" Fabre | $3,200

Lucky comes from Belgium and has not really earned his nickname as he seems to be followed by bad luck. Fatherless childhood, many experiences. Then he discovered someone having a go at his little sister and in his rage, broke the persons neck: an accident. The victim was unfortunately a VIP and therefore Luc had go underground by the mercenaries.

Additional Info: This muscleman is a weapon on legs. Close combat would be enough for him, but with automatic weapons he is unbeatable!
