Lennart "Scream" Vilde | $2,600

Scream is a leader type, infectious to others. A bit of a joker, with a strange sense of humour.
Like Janno Allik he originates from Estonia and has a German mother. Unhappy childhood in Siberia, but made him harder.
Night operations and automatic weapons are his greatest strengths.

Additional Info: Happy to go where ever Janno Allik goes. Both men became mercenaries after the Russian withdrawal from East Germany.
