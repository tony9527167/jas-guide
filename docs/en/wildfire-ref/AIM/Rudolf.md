Rudolf Steiger | $6,800

This former GSG 9 man has only one weakness... Dr. Laura Colin, whom he met during special training in Lübeck.  
He is an absolute pro—night operations are his strength.  
He can also shoot the nuts off a squirrel's paws from 3 km.  
Has the talent to become a trainer.

Additional Info: His mode of expression leaves a lot to be desired. Works well with Henning von Branitz, but Gasket is the red cloth in a bullring.
