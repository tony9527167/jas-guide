Sidney Nettleson | $2600

Whether it's sharing a spot of tea with British blue-bloods or putting a .38 slug into an unwanted nuisance, Sidney does it with poise and dignity.
Sidney combines the mannerisms of the upper crust with the lightning quickness of a Wild West gunslinger. Years of avid cricket-playing have also given him a much-feared throwing arm.
