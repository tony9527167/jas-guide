Igor Dolvich | $2,200

Following in his uncle's footsteps won't be easy for Igor. His uncle Ivan Dolvich is legendary.
Though Igor may be new to A.I.M. but he is by no means new to armed conflict. He perfected his stealth abilities while seeing intensive action in Chechnya. And did we mention Ivan Dolvich was his uncle? A bloodline simply impossible to ignore.
