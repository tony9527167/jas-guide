Victor "Monk" Kolesnikov | $2,900

The Russian-born Victor Kolesnikov is exactly who you'd call a hard case.  
Automatic weapons are his area of skill.  
He often seeks solitude and does not speak any more than necessary, which is why his comrades call him "Monk."  
A fitting nickname for this taciturn pro, who is also a camouflage expert.

Additional Info: He has a problem with his fellow Russian, Ivan. Because of his experiences in Chechnya, he is choosy about his clients.
