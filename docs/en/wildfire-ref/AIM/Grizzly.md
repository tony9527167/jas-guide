Steve "Grizzly" Bornell | $1,100

A bear of a man, Grizzly Bornell carries the big guns of battle with authority. Even though heavy weapons are his speciality, he is just as lethal when left empty-handed. He's a soldier's soldier--all guts and no need for glory. Not surprisingly, his combat exploits are almost always the talk of the plane ride home.
