Dr. Michael Dawson | $800

Fresh out of med school, Doctor Dawson eagerly awaits his first assignment.
Although his innocent and youthful appearance has prevented others from taking him seriously but rest assured, once he saves a couple of lives, he'll be shown the kind of respect he deserves.

Additional Info: For a man who just completed his internship, he can certainly wield a mean scalpel.
