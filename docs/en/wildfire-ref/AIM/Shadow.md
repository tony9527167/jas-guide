Kyle "Shadow" Simmons | $4,600

This ex-Ranger and sniper has turned stalking into an art form.  
Shadow could be lurking right next to you, and you'd never know it.  
That snow drift, dune, shrub, or satellite dish could easily be his master of sneak.  
Kyle Simmons is a soldier who has made it his business to blend into any environment for any length of time.

Additional Info: The Shadow brings his own camouflage supplies and wishes to make it known up front that he doesn't share.
