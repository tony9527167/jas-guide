Bobby "Steroid" Gontarski | $1,400

The transition from fighting fires to fire-fights has been a blazing success for this ex-fireman from Warsaw.  
His knack for electronics kept the outdated, underfunded Polish firehouse running.  
Now, his eagle-eyed vision and relentless drive are keeping his enemies on the run.

Additional Info: Gontarski refuses to submit to urine testing.
