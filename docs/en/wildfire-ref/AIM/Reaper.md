Carl "Reaper" Sheppards | $6,000

Otherwise known as "The Assassin", if you come face-to-face with Sheppards, chances are you're about to take your last breath.  
Reaper takes pride in his patience. His silent stride and lockpicking skills make gaining access to his victims easy.  
On a personal note, Carl gets a kick out of spitting in their eyes just before they die.

Additional Info: One of his former COs described him as "too dangerous even for military service."
