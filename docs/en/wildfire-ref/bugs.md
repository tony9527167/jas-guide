# JA2 Wildfire Reference - Bugs

## Compatibility Issues

### Windows 10

- Both the GOG and Steam versions are buggy on Windows 10 21H2. Saving game takes 5~10 seconds, but only about less than 2 seconds on Windows 7.

- GOG's JA2WF is not compatible with NVIDIA GeForce Experience on Windows 10 21H2
  - The game becomes unresponsive to mouse input after pressing Alt+Z to open the GeForce Experience panel.
  - **Walk-around/Solution**: GOG's JA2WF is compatible with Game Bar 7.325.11061.0 on Windows 10 21H2, use it instead of GeForce Experience.

## Vehicle

Ice Truck

- Passenger count shows 5, but the game reports "6 passengers, full."
- Raven cannot board the Ice Truck.
- Clicking the vehicle to confirm movement to a designated area causes the game to crash.

## Sectors

G8

- If you find Joey then speak to Martha, it will never complete the Find Martha's Son mission.
- Walk-around:
  - Take Joey go away from G8 sector
  - Send mercenary talk to Martha
  - Bring Joey back to G8 and talk to Martha again
  - NEVER TAKE JOEY AND TALK TO Martha at the same time at the first time!
